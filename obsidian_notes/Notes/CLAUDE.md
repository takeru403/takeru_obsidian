# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an Obsidian vault containing personal notes in Japanese. The repository contains markdown files with YAML frontmatter for metadata including:
- `title`: Note title
- `aliases`: Alternative names for the note
- `uid`: Unique identifier (timestamp-based)
- `created`: Creation timestamp
- `updated`: Last modified timestamp
- `tags`: Categorization tags

## File Structure

- Notes are stored as timestamped markdown files (format: `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.md`)
- Each note has YAML frontmatter with metadata
- Content is primarily in Japanese
- No build system, tests, or linting commands are present

## Development Notes

This is a personal note-taking repository using Obsidian. There are no compilation steps, test suites, or deployment processes. When working with files:

- Preserve the YAML frontmatter structure
- Maintain the timestamp-based naming convention for new notes
- Keep content in Japanese as appropriate
- Update the `updated` field when modifying existing notes

## Git Information
