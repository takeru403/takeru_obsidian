Detecting stress in plants is crucial for both open-farm and controlled-environment agri

culture. Biomolecules within plants serve as key stress indicators, offering vital markers


for continuous health monitoring and early disease detection. Raman spectroscopy pro

vides a powerful, non-invasive means to quantify these biomolecules through their molec

ular vibrational signatures. However, traditional Raman analysis relies on customized data

processing workflows that require fluorescence background removal and prior identifica

tion of Raman peaks of interest—introducing potential biases and inconsistencies. Here,


we introduce DIVA (Deep-learning-based Investigation of Vibrational Raman spectra for


plant-stress Analysis), a fully automated workflow based on a variational autoencoder. Un

like conventional approaches, DIVA processes native Raman spectra—including fluorescence


backgrounds—without manual preprocessing, identifying and quantifying significant spec

tral features in an unbiased manner. We applied DIVA to detect a range of plant stresses,


including abiotic (shading, high light intensity, high temperature) and biotic stressors (bacte

rial infections). By integrating deep learning with vibrational spectroscopy, DIVA paves the


way for AI-driven plant health assessment, fostering more resilient and sustainable agricul

tural practices.

Recent advances in precision agriculture—in particular, the development of data acquisition


and diagnostic technologies [1] —have significantly improved our ability to monitor plant health. A


key enabler of this progress has been the development of techniques for the quantitative and non

invasive detection of important biomolecules within plants [2–4] . These biomolecules provide crucial


information on the condition of the plants, including their exposure and subsequent response to


various stressors [5] . These stresses can be either abiotic [6,7] —caused by non-living factors such as low


and high light conditions, extreme temperatures, drought, waterlogging, or nutrient deficiencies—


or biotic [6,7] —caused by living organisms such as pathogens and pests. Since these stresses can


significantly impact plant growth, overall health, and yield, their early detection is critical for


effective crop management [8] .


To better understand and manage plant stress, advanced sensing technologies have been pro

posed to enable real-time monitoring of plants in modern agricultural practices [1,8–14] . In particular,


Raman spectroscopy has been shown to be able to identify biomolecules at key metabolic centers


in a plant, such as leaves and petioles [5,14,15] by analyzing their unique vibrational signatures [14,16] .


This makes it possible to accurately assess plant health and detect early stress. Moreover, portable


Raman spectroscopy systems [17,18], which can be easily deployed in the field, have proven particu

larly useful for acquiring data from hard-to-access metabolic sites within plants, providing deeper


insights into their condition.


However, despite recent progress in the application of Raman spectroscopy to monitor plant


health, several challenges have seriously limited its application [19] . In particular, processing Raman


spectra still requires manual intervention, which can introduce biases, inconsistencies, and errors.


First, custom methods are usually needed to remove background fluorescence, which would other

wise obscure the Raman signatures of biomolecules [19–21] . Additionally, Raman spectra need to be


normalized, often by using their integrated intensity or the intensity of a single wavenumber as a


3


reference, which assumes that these intensities remain stable across plant states. Finally, it is nec

essary to identify the specific wavenumbers corresponding to the biomolecules of interest within


the Raman spectra [5] . This process typically requires prior knowledge about which biomolecules


are most likely to be affected by a particular type of stress, limiting the ability to detect broader,


unexpected changes in the plant’s metabolic profile. This narrow focus on specific biomolecules


reduces the ability to capture changes throughout the spectrum, thus overlooking unexpected stress


responses in the plant. For this reason, the current approaches used to process Raman spectra are


often stress-specific and designed to detect changes in a specific small set of biomolecules [5] . Ef

forts have been made to standardize Raman data processing [22], such as by using fixed parameters


to remove the baseline and smooth the spectrum [5,15,19] . Still, even these parameters can vary from


user to user, introducing bias and inconsistency [19,23] . These challenges reduce the overall reliability


of Raman spectroscopy in detecting plant stress in a generalized way.


In order to fully realize the potential of Raman spectroscopy as a technology to detect plant


stress, these limitations must be overcome. Therefore, advances are needed in automating Raman


spectral processing, reducing manual intervention, and developing more generalizable approaches


to automatically detect a wide range of biomolecules under different stress conditions. Improv

ing these aspects will help enhance the reproducibility, reliability, and overall utility of Raman


spectroscopy, particularly within precision agriculture.


Here, we propose DIVA, a fully automated technique that uses a variational autoencoder to


process native Raman spectra, including fluorescence background, to identify and quantify signif

icant Raman peaks. We have successfully applied DIVA to detect abiotic stresses (due to shading,


various light conditions, and high temperature) and biotic stresses (due to bacterial infections). By


comparing the Raman spectra of plants under normal and stressed conditions, DIVA automatically


identifies the significant Raman peaks, enabling unbiased identification of stress markers and ulti

4


mately paving the way for more resilient agricultural practices and smarter AI-driven plant health


monitoring systems.


Results


DIVA to analyze Raman spectra. In a typical application of Raman spectroscopy to monitor


plant health, Raman spectra are acquired from healthy and stressed plants, specifically from key


metabolic areas such as leaves and petioles [5], as schematically illustrated in Fig. 1a. These spectra


provide molecular fingerprints that reflect the presence and abundance of biomolecular signatures


associated with various metabolic processes, thus indicating plant health [6,17] . In healthy plants,


specific biomolecules appear within expected intensity ranges, whereas stressed plants often show


distinct variations, allowing differentiation based on these unique spectral patterns.


Standard Raman spectra processing involves several preparatory steps, including baseline


correction and removal of the fluorescence background noise commonly present in biological sam

ples [19,24,25] (Figs. 1b-c). This background fluorescence can overwhelm the actual Raman signals,


complicating interpretation and often requiring custom correction steps [19,21] . However, fluores

cence removal methods vary and can lead to inconsistent results, as different techniques may em

phasize or obscure distinct parts of the spectrum.


Instead, DIVA does not require manually removing the fluorescence background and iden

tifying a priori the relevant Raman peaks. It operates in two key steps. The first step reduces


the influence of fluorescence by calculating the first derivative, D(˜v), of the raw Raman spectra,


I(˜v), where ˜v represents the wavenumbers at which the Raman intensity is acquired. Using this


derivative, we avoid the need for background correction and normalization, as the derivative of the


slowly varying fluorescence background is smaller than the derivative of the fast varying Raman


peaks without requiring ad hoc background fitting procedures (Fig. 1d). This approach enhances


5


the spectral features, making subtle shifts in biomolecular signatures easier to detect.


The second step provides an automated analysis of these differentiated spectra using a vari

ational autoencoder (VAE). The VAE’s encoder (depicted in Fig. 1e) transforms each input spec

trum into a point in the latent space, condensing the complex spectral information into a lower

dimensional representation while retaining the critical characteristics of the original data (Fig. 1f).


This latent space organizes similar spectra into clusters based on shared features, creating distinct


groupings that correlate with different stressed states of the plant. The latent space generated by


the VAE has two critical properties: continuity and completeness. Continuity ensures that closely


placed points in the latent space yield similar decoded outputs, preserving the relationship between


similar spectra. Completeness ensures that every sampled point within a cluster in the latent space


corresponds to a meaningful spectral representation, providing a strong foundation for interpre

tation without losing essential data from the original Raman spectra. From this latent space, the


VAE’s decoder (Fig. 1g) reconstructs the spectral content by focusing on the median of each clus

ter. This approach is important because it allows us to accurately sample representative points from


each cluster, allowing the reproduction of the average characteristic spectra, D(˜v) (Fig. 1h), repre

senting the clusters in the latent space. This reconstruction captures key biomolecular signatures


indicative of plant stress, providing a reliable indicator of stress conditions.


Our method for detecting significant Raman peaks for a particular stressed state of the plant


relies on identifying zero crossings in the reconstructed characteristic derivative of the Raman


spectrum D(˜v) (Fig. 1h), specifically focusing on crossings where the derivative changes from


positive to negative. These particular crossings indicate the locations of peaks in the original


spectra, I(v˜). We apply this technique to the reconstructed spectra, with one spectrum generated for


each cluster. An important aspect of this approach is that it does not require any prior assumptions


or hypotheses about which peaks to analyze, and therefore it provides a direct and systematic means


6


of identifying peaks that correlate with important biomolecules. Furthermore, by calculating the


area under the curve, A(v˜), at these peak positions (illustrated in Fig. 1i), we obtain a quantitative


measure of the concentrations of the biomolecules at specific wavenumbers. This feature of DIVA


improves reproducibility and accuracy by eliminating the need for manual peak assignment, which


is prone to user bias.


Finally, DIVA enables comparisons of different plant stress conditions by evaluating A(v˜)


across various states. Identifying and comparing the most significant Raman peaks for each state


(shown in Fig. 1i), we can evaluate the intensities of these peaks at relevant wavenumbers, allow

ing for a comprehensive assessment of stress levels under different environmental and biological


stress conditions. This method provides valuable insights into how plants respond to stress on a


biomolecular level and establishes an unbiased framework for monitoring plant health using Ra

man spectroscopy.


To demonstrate the versatility of DIVA, we examined several common stresses that affect


plants in traditional farming. We categorized these stresses into two types: abiotic (e.g., stresses


due to shade avoidance, varying light conditions, and high temperature) and biotic (e.g., stress due


to bacterial infection). Our studies included various plant species, such as Arabidopsis, Choy Sum,


and Kai Lan, showcasing the broad applicability of our approach across different species.


Decoding light stress responses in diverse plant species. We began by exploring light stress as


a key example of an abiotic factor to evaluate how well DIVA performs across different conditions


and plant species. In this study, we first used Arabidopsis plants exposed to four light conditions:


white light (as the control), high light, low light, and shade. Wildtype Arabidopsis grown under


these light stresses developed distinct phenotypes, reflecting how plants respond to different light


stresses. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 1, high light led to shorter petioles and large curled


leaves, while low light and shade caused petiole elongation and reduced leaf growth.


7


The latent space derived from the Arabidopsis leaf data under these conditions is shown in


Fig. 2a. Looking at the medians of the clusters, a clear trend was observed: as the light intensity


decreased from high light to white light, low light, and shade, the median points were well sep

arated and gradually shifted from left to right. This shows that the molecular composition of the


leaves changed systematically depending on the light levels, with brighter light conditions produc

ing distinct molecular signatures compared to lower light conditions.


We then reconstructed the spectra from the median points of each light condition in the la

tent space. The reconstructed spectra are shown in Fig. 2b (top).To better understand the plant


response, we calculated the absolute area under the curve for each peak along the spectrum. This


allowed us to identify the most significant peaks that characterize the response under each light


condition, shown in Fig. 2b (bottom). These peaks were associated with key biomolecules, includ

ing carotenoids (1521 cm [-1], 1151 cm [-1], and 1180 cm [-1] ), cellulose/lignin/protein (1318 cm [-1] ), and


pectin (742 cm [-1] ) [15] . The significant Raman peaks matched those seen when the Raman spectra


(shown in Supplementary Fig. 2) were reconstructed from their derivatives, reflecting consistent


trends and supporting the reliability of the method.


Under different light conditions—high light, white light, low light, and shade—plants un

dergo coordinated changes in biomolecules such as carotenoids, cellulose, lignin, protein, and


pectin to adapt their growth and mitigate stress. Carotenoids, in particular, were found to be


strongly modulated under different light conditions. Carotenoids play a key role in the protection


of plants by dissipating excess light energy and preventing photo-oxidative damage [26] . In high


light conditions, plants increase carotenoid levels to protect against excess light stress. In low


light and shade, the need for this protection decreases, so plants reduce carotenoid production to


conserve energy and focus on improving light capture. In high light, cellulose and lignin levels


generally increase to reinforce the cell wall and protect against photodamage, while protein levels


8


increase, especially stress-related proteins such as antioxidants and repair enzymes. The pectin


content can also increase slightly or become structurally modified to maintain the rigidity of the


cell walls and protect against oxidative damage. In contrast, under low light and shade, cellulose


and lignin levels typically decrease, allowing the plant to conserve energy on cell wall reinforce

ment and maintain more flexible walls to support elongation growth. Protein levels may either


decrease overall—especially with a reduction in photosynthesis-related proteins—or shift in com

position toward enzymes involved in cell wall remodeling and growth regulation. Pectin levels


also decrease or change in composition to make the cell wall more flexible, allowing faster stem


and petiole elongation—as part of the shade avoidance strategy. These molecular adjustments,


summarized in Supplementary Table 1, reflect the plant’s ability to dynamically balance structural


integrity and growth depending on the surrounding light environment. The ability of DIVA to


detect and track these changes across different light environments highlights how the method can


capture biologically meaningful molecular regulation in plants—a key part of their photoacclima

tion strategies under varying light conditions.


Next, we extended the light stress study to include Choy Sum and Kai Lan, to test whether


DIVA could capture light stress-related molecular signatures across species beyond Arabidopsis.


The phenotypes of Choy Sum and Kai Lan under light stress are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1.


These two species, both leafy vegetables but with different growth habits and environmental adap

tations, provided a useful comparison to assess how broadly DIVA could detect and differentiate


light stress responses.


The general pattern of median shifts and the significant Raman peaks identified by DIVA in


response to light stress were consistent between Choy Sum and Kai Lan, similar to Arabidopsis as


evident from Figs. 2c-d and Figs. 2e-f. Interestingly, the clusters for Choy Sum and Kai Lan were


less compact, as observed in Figs. 2c and 2e, especially under low light and shade, indicating a


9


greater variation in their Raman spectra between individual plants compared to Arabidopsis. For


both Choy Sum and Kai Lan, the medians for white light and high light clusters were well separated


from those of low light and shade. The low light and shade medians were much closer to each other,


suggesting that the plant response to these two light conditions was similar. These conditions are


known to trigger petiole elongation and reduced leaf blade growth (Supplementary Fig. 1), which


is consistent with the observed clustering pattern. Significant peaks associated with carotenoids


(1521 cm [-1], 1150 cm [-1], and 1178 cm [-1] ), cellulose / lignin / protein (1317 cm [-1] ), and pectin (743


cm [-1] ) [15] were also observed for both Choy Sum and Kai Lan, as shown in Figs. 2d and 2f. However,


the amplitude of the significant peaks varied between species, as can be observed in Figs. 2b, 2d,


and 2f and Supplementary Figs. 2-4, reflecting species-specific differences in molecular responses


to light stress.


In general, consistent trends across all three species highlight the potential of DIVA to track


light stress responses in diverse plants. These findings demonstrate that DIVA can capture both


species-specific responses and common molecular patterns, showcasing its robustness in identi

fying shared and unique adaptations to light stress. Refer to “Light stress study” in Methods for


experiment details.


Decoding gene-specific shade avoidance stress responses. To evaluate the robustness of DIVA


in the capture of stress-induced molecular changes in plants, we extended our analysis to include


genotypes with impaired photoreceptor function, focusing specifically on their responses to shade


avoidance stress. Specifically, we examined whether DIVA could detect shade avoidance responses


in mutant Arabidopsis lines, providing insight into how genetic variation influences stress signa

tures.


For this study, we first used wildtype Arabidopsis plants exposed to three light conditions:


white light (control), moderate shade, and deep shade. Wildtype Arabidopsis developed different


10


phenotypes, reflecting how plants adjust their growth to different light conditions. As shown in


Supplementary Fig. 5, moderate and deep shade caused elongated petioles and smaller leaf blades,


typical shade avoidance responses.


The latent space derived from the Arabidopsis leaf data under these light conditions is shown


in Fig. 3a. Looking at the medians of the clusters, a clear upward shift was observed as the in

tensity of the shade increased from moderate to deep shade. This indicates that the molecular


composition of the leaves changed progressively under harsher shade conditions. Raman peaks


related to carotenoids (1521 cm [-1], 1151 cm [-1], and 1180 cm [-1] ), cellulose / lignin / protein (1318


cm [-1] ), and pectin (742 cm [-1] ) were highly responsive in different shades, as shown in Fig. 3b and


Supplementary Fig. 6.


Under white light, Arabidopsis plants maintain balanced levels of carotenoids, cellulose,


lignin, proteins, and pectin to support stable growth and photosynthesis. In moderate shade, the


photosynthetically active radiation is lower than in white light but still sufficient for photosynthe

sis, though at reduced intensity. The red-to-far-red (R:FR) light ratio decreases and plants initiate


shade avoidance responses. Carotenoids decrease slightly because there is less need for photopro

tection. Cellulose and lignin production decreases slightly to allow cell wall flexibility and support


elongation. Photosynthesis-related proteins decrease, while growth-regulating enzymes become


more prominent. The pectin content decreases slightly or changes composition to enhance the


flexibility of the cell wall, allowing growth of the stem and petioles. In deep shade, the photosyn

thetically active radiation is much lower, often just a fraction of the radiation available in white


light, making it difficult for plants to perform photosynthesis efficiently. The R:FR ratio drops


significantly, intensifying shade avoidance responses in plants.


We then examined two light-signaling Arabidopsis mutants to investigate how different geno

types respond to shade avoidance stress and whether DIVA can capture stress-related signatures


11


from mutant plants. The first mutant phyA-211 knocks out Phytochrome A (PHYA), which is


responsible for suppressing the shade response under low R:FR light [27], such as in shaded condi

tions. The second mutant phyB-9 [BC] knocks out Phytochrome B (PHYB), which is responsible for


suppressing the shade response under high R:FR conditions such as white light [27] .


PHYA and PHYB play an essential role in controlling shade avoidance stress in Arabidop

sis [5] . PHYA helps detect low R:FR light and reduces the plant’s response to shade by prevent

ing excessive seedling elongation. Without PHYA, the plant becomes more sensitive to shade,


such as under moderate and deep shade conditions, especially sensitive in deep shade. Previ

ous studies have shown that the phyA-211 mutant behaves like the wildtype under white light but


exhibits stronger shade avoidance responses under shaded conditions [5] . Consistent with this, phyA

211 plants displayed more pronounced shade phenotypes, such as elongated petioles and smaller


leaves—under shade (see Supplementary Fig. 5), confirming that the loss of PHYA leads to a more


severe shade avoidance response. This is evident in the latent space (see Fig. 3c), where the medi

ans of the phyA-211 samples in shade shift further away from the median of the phyA-211 samples


under white light. The significant Raman peaks observed were similar to those of the wildtype,


involving carotenoids, cellulose / lignin / proteins, and pectin, as shown in Fig. 3d. In particular,


carotenoid peaks, especially at 1521 cm [-1] and 1151 cm [-1], were significantly impacted in the phyA

211 mutant under deep shade, likely due to enhanced light stress responses to deep shade in the


absence of PHYA (see Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 7).


PHYB is active in high R:FR light and helps suppress shade avoidance traits such as petiole


elongation and reduced leaf blade size. When PHYB is knocked out, as in the phyB-9 [BC] mutant,


this suppression is lost, leading plants to show a strong shade avoidance behavior even under white


light. This is reflected in the typical shade phenotypes of the mutant, such as elongated petioles


and small rosette leaves, observed under white light conditions (see Supplementary Fig. 5). This


12


pattern is also reflected in the latent space (see Fig. 3e), where the medians of phyB-9 [BC] plants in


white light and deep shade are closely located. The significant Raman peaks observed for phyB-9 [BC]


plants were comparable to those of the wildtype, involving carotenoids, cellulose / lignin / proteins


and pectin. However, in both white light and deep shade, the biomolecular profiles remained


similar, as seen in Fig. 3f and Supplementary Fig. 8, due to the constitutive shade response of phyB

9 [BC] plants. Notably, the medians for all three conditions tended to shift toward the upper left corner


of the latent space, highlighting that the PHYB variant behaves in a similar way across different


light conditions. Furthermore, based on the location of the medians, the responses of phyB-9 [BC]


plants to white light and deep shade were similar to each other, but distinct from their moderate


shade response (see Fig. 3f and Supplementary Fig. 8). This suggests that while PHYB plays an


important role in regulating shade responses, it is not acting alone—other signaling components or


pathways likely contribute to how plants respond to varying light environments.


Overall, the findings matched the expected trends in both wildtype and mutant plants under


shade avoidance stress, underscoring DIVA’s ability to monitor responses across diverse geno

types. DIVA reliably identified genotype-specific differences and common molecular patterns,


demonstrating its strength in revealing shared and distinct adaptations to shade stress. Refer to


“Shade avoidance stress study” in Methods for experiment details.


Decoding high-temperature stress responses. Understanding how temperature extremes affect


plant physiology is critical to improving crop resilience. To evaluate whether DIVA can detect


species-specific molecular responses to heat, we studied wildtype Arabidopsis, Choy Sum, and Kai


Lan plants exposed to high ambient temperatures. This cross-species analysis aimed to uncover


how different plants adapt at the molecular level to prolonged heat stress.


Wildtype Arabidopsis plants were initially grown at 21 [o] C (control) and then exposed to 29 [o] C


for varying durations, as outlined in Supplementary Fig. 9. All plants were in the same develop

13


mental stage at the end of treatment. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 10, heat-exposed Arabidop

sis plants developed elongated petioles—a classic thermomorphogenic response that increases leaf


separation to improve air circulation and reduce localized heat build-up.


The latent space derived from Arabidopsis leaf data under control and high-temperature con

ditions is shown in Fig. 4a. After 2 days of high-temperature treatment, the median position shifted


away from the control, indicating early biomolecular changes. By day 4, the median remained


close to the day-2 position, suggesting a limited additional change. By day 6, the data split into


two distinct clusters—one at the top and one at the bottom—reflecting varied responses, with only


some plants showing visible signs of yellowing and senescence. This divergence likely reflects


differing physiological states: while some plants maintained biomolecular balance under sustained


heat, others crossed a physiological threshold leading to structural and metabolic decline.


These shifts in the latent space implied clear changes in key biomolecules. Raman peaks,


especially for carotenoids at 1521 cm [-1], 1151 cm [-1], and 1180 cm [-1], cellulose / lignin / protein at


1318 cm [-1], and pectin at 742 cm [-1], were markedly responsive, as evident from Fig. 4b and Supple

mentary Fig. 11. Carotenoids decreased, probably due to oxidative damage and reduced protective


capacity against reactive oxygen species. Structural components such as cellulose, lignin, and pro

teins also declined, reflecting heat-induced degradation and possible remodeling of the cell wall.


Pectin levels showed a similar drop, suggesting a loosening of cell walls as part of the adaptive


strategy of plants. However, prolonged or intense heat can lead to excessive degradation in Ara

bidopsis, compromising structural integrity and contributing to wilting and/or senescence. This ex

pectation aligned with the observations on day 6, where the latent space data split into two distinct


clusters—one group representing plants that maintained molecular stability, and another showing


clear signs of senescence, including yellowing (see Fig. 4a). To illustrate these differences, the


representative Raman peaks shown for the day 6 time point in Fig. 4b reflect the overall median


14


signature of the entire group of the day 6 time point (see Fig. 4a), without excluding any data


points. This highlights DIVA’s strength in uncovering subtle but meaningful intragroup variations.


Together, these observations demonstrate that while Arabidopsis can mount an early response to


high temperature, prolonged exposure eventually impairs its ability to maintain essential molecular


functions.


In contrast, Choy Sum plants appeared to be more tolerant to high temperatures. Choy Sum


plants were grown at 24 [o] C and then exposed to 33 [o] C for varying durations, as shown in Supplemen

tary Fig. 12. All plants were in the same developmental stage at the end of treatment. Phenotypic


observations showed that Choy Sum exhibited minimal signs of heat-induced stress, with little


visible thermomorphogenesis compared to Arabidopsis, as evident from Supplementary Fig. 13.


The latent space derived from Choy Sum leaf data under control and high temperature con

ditions is shown in Fig. 4c. The medians of the clusters—each representing a different time point


under high-temperature treatment—were mostly positioned near the top of the latent space, with


the control group forming a distinct cluster close to them. Notably, these clusters occupied a dif

ferent region of the latent space compared to Arabidopsis, highlighting the biological distinction


of Choy Sum plants from Arabidopsis and the species-specific differences in their response to high


temperature. The medians of 2 to 6 day time points overlapped substantially, suggesting that the


biomolecular profile of Choy Sum plants remained largely stable throughout the period of pro

longed heat exposure. This minimal spectral shift indicates a muted stress response, consistent


with the phenotypic evidence of Choy Sum’s apparent tolerance to high temperatures. In particu

lar, while a clear separation was observed between the control and day 2 medians, the medians of


subsequent time points (day 4 and day 6) remained close to the day 2 median, further supporting


the idea that most of the biomolecular adjustments occurred early in the heat treatment period.


In Choy Sum, the significant Raman peaks identified under high temperature treatment are


15


shown in Fig. 4d. They were consistent with those observed earlier: carotenoids at 1521 cm [-1], 1150


cm [-1], and 1178 cm [-1] ; cellulose/lignin/protein at 1317 cm [-1] ; and pectin at 743 cm [-1] . These peaks


showed a marked increase in intensity from control to day 2, followed by only minimal changes


by days 4 and 6. This pattern indicates an early biomolecular adjustment to high temperature, with


limited further modulation over time. The same trend was evident in the reconstructed Raman


spectra (see Supplementary Fig. 14) obtained from the cluster medians in the latent space, fur

ther confirming the observation of early but sustained biomolecular responses. This early upward


shift in biomolecular levels probably reflects the enhanced accumulation or preservation of these


compounds in response to high temperatures. Carotenoids may have increased due to their role


in photoprotection and quenching of reactive oxygen species, buffering the plant against oxidative


stress. Similarly, the rise in cellulose, lignin, and protein-associated signals points to the reinforce

ment of the cell walls, contributing to mechanical resilience. The elevated pectin signals suggest


ongoing cell wall remodeling to maintain cellular integrity.


Taken together, the location of the cluster medians in the latent space, the early biomolecular


increase, and the sustained Raman intensity levels over time suggest that Choy Sum employs a


front-loaded molecular strategy to cope with heat—markedly different from the continuous decline


observed in Arabidopsis.


Lastly, we examined Kai Lan plants to further understand species-specific responses to high


temperature. Kai Lan was grown under the same conditions as Choy Sum (see Supplemen

tary Fig. 12). Kai Lan exhibited a distinct physiological and biomolecular response to heat stress,


with phenotypic signs such as yellowing of mature leaves and purple coloration in young ones, as


shown in Supplementary Fig. 15.


The latent space derived from Kai Lan leaf data under control and high-temperature condi

tions is shown in Fig. 4e. The clusters representing heat-treated time points (days 2, 4, and 6) were


16


distributed along the lower and right regions of the latent space, contrasting with the locations of


these clusters observed in Arabidopsis (see Fig. 4a) and Choy Sum (see Fig. 4c). Notably, the


progressive shift in cluster medians—from minimal displacement at day 2 to clear separation at


day 6—indicates a cumulative and dynamic biomolecular response to heat stress.


This trajectory was mirrored in the significant Raman peaks shown in Fig. 4f, where the re

lated biomolecular content showed a gradual increase over time. These peaks, consistent with those


seen in Choy Sum, include carotenoids at 1521 cm [-1], 1150 cm [-1], and 1178 cm [-1] ; cellulose / lignin /


protein at 1317 cm [-1] ; and pectin at 743 cm [-1] . Unlike Choy Sum, where most biomolecular changes


occurred early, Kai Lan showed a stepwise increase in Raman peak intensities from day 2 to day


6, indicating a continued and evolving response to prolonged heat exposure. This temporal pro

gression was also clearly reflected in the reconstructed Raman spectra (see Supplementary Fig. 16)


obtained from the latent space medians, supporting the DIVA-based observations.


Together, the progressive shifts of the medians in the latent space, the steadily increasing


significant Raman peaks, and the Raman intensities in the reconstructed spectra indicate that Kai


Lan responds to heat stress through a cumulative biomolecular adaptation. This contrasts with the


early stabilized response seen in Choy Sum and the overall decline observed in Arabidopsis. These


distinctions underscore Kai Lan’s unique and dynamic strategy to cope with prolonged high tem

peratures and highlight DIVA’s sensitivity in capturing nuanced species-specific stress trajectories.

Decoding bacterial-infection induced stress responses. Understanding how plants respond to


biotic stress, such as bacterial infection, is critical to improving crop protection and resistance.


To explore how plants react at the molecular level to bacterial pathogens and immune elicitors,


we applied DIVA to study Choy Sum and Arabidopsis plants infiltrated with different bacterial


treatments over time.


17


To investigate pathogen-induced responses, Choy Sum plants were infiltrated with a bacte

rial suspension, while buffer-infiltrated plants served as controls at each time point. Raman spec

tra were collected from leaves 24 and 48 hours post-infiltration to monitor biomolecular changes


during the course of infection. The corresponding leaf phenotypes are shown in Supplemen

tary Fig. 17. The buffer- and pathogen-infiltrated leaves appeared healthy, with no visible signs


of infection observable 48 hours post-infiltration.


The latent space derived from the 24-hour post-infiltration data is shown in Fig. 5a. The


medians of the pathogen- and buffer-infiltrated groups were slightly separated, indicating early


molecular divergence. The extracted features in Fig. 5b and the reconstructed Raman signals in


Supplementary Fig. 18 revealed specific biomolecular changes, with significant peaks detected for


carotenoids (1521 cm [-1] and 1150 cm [-1] ), cellulose / lignin / proteins (1317 cm [-1] ), and pectin (743


cm [-1] ).


By 24 hours post-infiltration, carotenoid levels had decreased slightly in pathogen-infiltrated


plants compared to buffer-infiltrated controls. This modest reduction may have reflected the early


mobilization of carotenoids to counteract the oxidative stress induced by the presence of pathogens.


In contrast, compounds such as cellulose, lignin, protein, and pectin exhibited minimal changes,


possibly indicating that structural remodeling or large-scale metabolic changes had not yet be

gun. Interestingly, a Raman peak at 1001 cm [-1] was significant only in buffer-infiltrated plants,


while a peak at 1178 cm [-1] appeared significant only in pathogen-infiltrated plants. This sug

gested the presence of a stress-induced metabolite or a marker of a specific bacterial response.


A plausible explanation for this pattern is that 24 hours post-infiltration, the 1001 cm [-1] peak was


significant in buffer-infiltrated plants due to a transient, nonspecific stress response caused by me

chanical infiltration. This peak, associated with phenylalanine and carotenoids, probably reflected


early warning signals or mild oxidative stress in the absence of pathogens. In pathogen-infiltrated


18


plants, the 1178 cm [-1] peak was significant, likely indicating an early pathogen-specific activation of


carotenoid metabolism in response to bacterial-induced oxidative stress. Although the 1001 cm [-1]


peak—representing general stress signals such as phenylalanine—may also have been present in


the pathogen group, the stronger carotenoid-related response at 1178 cm [-1] probably dominated the


Raman signal. This suggests that while both groups experienced early stress, bacterial infection


triggered a more specific and pronounced response that may have masked or shifted general stress


signals.


By 48 hours, the separation between the medians of the two groups increased (see Fig. 5c),


indicating a stronger and more consistent biomolecular impact from bacterial infection, as evi

denced by the reconstructed Raman signals in Supplementary Fig. 19. However, individual data


points were more spread across both groups, especially in pathogen-infiltrated samples, reflect

ing heterogeneous responses across different regions of the leaves. The significant Raman peaks


observed at 48 hours were the same as those at 24 hours (see Fig. 5d).


The decrease in carotenoid content was more pronounced in pathogen-infiltrated plants by


48 hours, suggesting a sustained or intensified response to oxidative stress. This continued decline


was likely due to the degradation or conversion of carotenoids into signaling molecules or antiox

idants as part of plant defense mechanisms. In contrast, relatively stable levels of cellulose, lignin,


protein, and pectin indicated that the infection had not yet progressed to a stage requiring signifi

cant structural or compositional changes in the cell wall or protein content. At this time point, the


1001 cm [-1] peak became significant in pathogen-infiltrated plants, while the 1178 cm [-1] peak became


significant in buffer-infiltrated plants. The 1001 cm [-1] peak probably reflected a stronger defense re

sponse involving the accumulation of protective compounds such as phenylalanine. The 1178 cm [-1]


peak in buffer-infiltrated plants may have indicated that these plants had largely recovered from the


initial infiltration stress. In general, these results suggest that buffer-infiltrated plants experienced


19


a brief and general stress response, whereas pathogen-infected plants mounted a persistent defense


reaction over time.


Taken together, these results demonstrate that DIVA can sensitively track the onset and pro

gression of pathogen-induced stress at the molecular level—even when no visible signs of infection


are present. The clear separation in latent space and the appearance of specific Raman peaks un

derscore the dynamic and time-sensitive response of the plants to the pathogen invasion. Refer to


“Bacterial stress study” in Methods for experiment details on pathogen-induced infection in Choy


Sum plants.


To explore immune-specific responses without direct pathogenic symptoms, we treated Ara

bidopsis plants with bacterial elicitors—specifically elf18 and flg22 peptides—known to induce


pattern-triggered immunity [15] . The plants were infiltrated with mock and bacterial elicitor suspen

sions and then sampled at three time points: 24, 48, and 72 hours post-infiltration. The mock

infiltrated plants served as controls.


At 24 hours, the latent space showed that elf18-infiltrated plants had a well-separated median


from the flg22 and mock groups (see Extended Data Fig. 1a), suggesting an early and distinct


immune response. Significant changes in carotenoids (1521 cm [-1], 1151 cm [-1], 1180 cm [-1] ), cellulose


/ lignin / protein (1318 cm [-1] ), and pectin (742 cm [-1] ) were observed in all groups, as evident from


Extended Data Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 20. These biomolecules are commonly involved in


cellular signaling, structural reinforcement, and oxidative protection. The elf18 group registered


an increase in the intensity of these Raman peaks compared to the mock and flg22 groups. This


pattern probably indicated that elf18 triggered a stronger and earlier defense response, marked by


biochemical and structural changes, compared to flg22 and mock treatments.


By 48 hours, the three groups showed clearly separated medians in the latent space (see


20


Extended Data Fig. 1c), indicating that both elicitors had triggered strong molecular responses.


The significant Raman peaks observed at 48 hours were the same as those at 24 hours (see Ex

tended Data Fig. 1d), except for a peak at 843 cm [-1] specific to the elf18 group. Notably, the


flg22-infiltrated group exhibited stronger Raman signals than the control and elf18 groups (see


Extended Data Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 21), suggesting a pronounced immune activation


by the 48-hour time point. Interestingly, the elf18 group showed weaker Raman signals than the


control at this stage, hinting at a possible oscillating immune behavior or molecular suppression


following initial activation. The emergence of the 843 cm [-1] peak in elf18-treated plants may have


reflected a specific biochemical response triggered by the elicitor. Since this peak has been associ

ated with phospholipids—key components of cell membranes and important signaling molecules


during stress—it may have indicated that immune activation had occurred at the membrane level.


The elf18 elicitor could have initiated processes such as lipid remodeling, membrane signaling, or


vesicle trafficking. These changes might have represented the preparation of the plant to defend


against the elf18 elicitor, making the 843 cm [-1] peak a potential marker of elf18-induced immune


responses at this time point.


At 72 hours, the medians of the three groups remained distinct in the latent space (see Ex

tended Data Fig. 1e). The significant Raman peaks observed at 72 hours were the same as those


at 24 hours (see Extended Data Fig. 1f and Supplementary Fig. 22). However, the elf18 group


now showed Raman intensities stronger than the mock, suggesting a continued oscillating immune


behavior and a resurgence in the immune response by the 72-hour time point. The flg22 group


showed weaker Raman intensities than the mock, also indicating an oscillating immune behavior


similar to the elf18 group. The pattern observed across all time points suggests that both elf18 and


flg22 groups exhibit oscillating phased responses to their respective bacterial elicitors; however,


elf18 triggers an earlier response, in contrast to the delayed activation seen in the flg22 group.


21


These findings underscore DIVA’s capability to detect elicitor-specific responses in plants,


offering a powerful approach to monitor immune dynamics. The time-dependent shifts in latent


space and Raman signatures highlight the fine-tuned nature of plant immune responses and how


they vary between elicitors. Refer to “Bacterial stress study” in Methods for experiment details on


elicitor-induced infection in Arabidopsis plants.


Discussion


In an era where climate resilience is essential for crop development, it is critical to decode plant


stress responses with precision and generalizability. This work introduces DIVA (Fig. 1) as an un

supervised method for analyzing Raman spectral data to reveal stress-related physiological changes


in plants.


DIVA provides a unified framework for the decoding of plant stress and is built on an


encoder-decoder architecture trained on the first derivatives D(v˜) of Raman spectra. This design


allows the model to learn from subtle spectral changes and form low-dimensional latent spaces that


reflect the biomolecular state of the plants. By bypassing the need for predefined labels or hand

crafted features, DIVA directly interprets high-dimensional Raman signals and captures stress pro

gression and adaptation across plant species.


DIVA demonstrated a robust capacity to capture early and nuanced molecular responses to


stress before visible phenotypic changes emerged. For example, in the high-temperature stress


study, the model revealed species-specific trajectories: Arabidopsis showed a clear decline in


molecular stability, Choy Sum exhibited a stabilization trend, and Kai Lan displayed a phased


adaptation over time. Importantly, DIVA also captured intragroup variation, most notably in Ara

bidopsis, highlighting divergent physiological responses between individuals subjected to the same


treatment. These results underscore how DIVA’s latent space effectively encodes complex spec

22


tral descriptors, including those not explicitly known to the researcher, and reconstructs them with


high fidelity. Furthermore, the ability of the model to automatically identify key stress-related


peaks from the first derivative spectra adds to its interpretability and practical value for plant stress


phenotyping.


DIVA’s latent space can be considered a reflection of the physiology of the plant species


considered, as it revealed distinct clustering behaviors that closely mirrored physiological stress


responses across different species. For example, in Arabidopsis subjected to high temperature


stress, two well-separated latent clusters emerged by day 6, corresponding to the onset of visible


senescence in a subset of plants. In contrast, Choy Sum exhibited significant cluster overlap, indi

cating a degree of molecular stability under stress. Meanwhile, Kai Lan showed a more continuous


shift in latent space, reflecting a gradual and adaptive physiological response. These emergent spa

tial patterns illustrate how DIVA can trace stress trajectories and infer physiological states using


the inherent structure of the data, without relying on predefined labels or supervision.


DIVA’s approach enables interpretable spectral analysis. Training on the first derivative D(v˜)


spectra enhances the model’s sensitivity to spectral gradients, which is essential for detecting subtle


biomolecular shifts. In addition, DIVA uses area-under-the-graph data A(v˜), derived from D(v˜), to


represent biomolecular content. This provides a robust and interpretable readout, as the integrated


area reflects both the presence and intensity of Raman-active features. By linking specific peaks


to underlying biochemical changes, this method allows for precise identification of biomolecular


responses, distinguishing DIVA from traditional Raman analysis techniques.


DIVA conserves biomarkers and species-specific strategies to handle stress. Despite differ

ences in response dynamics, a core set of stress-sensitive signatures—carotenoids, proteins, and


cell wall compounds—is observed. For example, in the study of high temperature stress, Ara

bidopsis experienced a steady decline, suggesting molecular breakdown; Choy Sum showed an


23


early increase that later stabilized; and Kai Lan exhibited a gradual rise, indicating ongoing adap

tation. These patterns suggest that while biomarkers are conserved, their modulation strategies


differ across species—a finding made accessible through DIVA’s ability to encode and decode


spectral features under varying conditions. In addition, DIVA demonstrated generalizability across


multiple stressors. It generalized well across plant types and stress conditions, indicating its poten

tial to detect and differentiate multiple stress factors within a single model. This flexibility makes


DIVA suitable for deployment in complex real-world agricultural datasets.


Conceptually, DIVA offers several advantages over traditional dimensionality reduction and


visualization methods commonly used in biological studies, such as Principal Component Anal

ysis (PCA) and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), which lack reconstructive


feedback and probabilistic modeling. In contrast, DIVA employs unbiased learning without the


need for labeled data. Its smooth latent space captures continuous biological variation over time,


while dimensionality reduction helps suppress noise and highlight key features. Importantly, the


model’s reconstructive feedback ensures that the learned latent representations remain grounded in


biologically meaningful patterns. Together, these design elements position DIVA as a promising


alternative to traditional approaches for generating interpretable insights from complex spectral


data.


Although DIVA offers significant advantages in unbiased spectral analysis, several limita

tions must be acknowledged. First, DIVA is inherently restricted to the detection of Raman-active


compounds, which means that it currently cannot capture physiological changes associated with


non-Raman-active markers, such as hormones. To address this, future work could involve integrat

ing Raman spectroscopy with complementary modalities such as transcriptomics, hyperspectral


imaging, or mass spectrometry, enabling a multimodal framework that captures a broader range of


stress responses. Second, although environmental conditions such as light, humidity, and temper

24


ature were tightly controlled in our experiments, DIVA does not explicitly model these external


factors. This limitation is common across all analytical methods and could affect robustness when


applied in field settings where such variables fluctuate. Incorporating domain adaptation tech

niques or adversarial learning could help the model learn domain-invariant representations, en

hancing its generalization to diverse and uncontrolled environments. Finally, while DIVA’s latent


space captures meaningful patterns related to the plant’s response to stress, the individual dimen

sions of this space are not yet directly linked to specific biological variables. In other words, the


structure of the latent space is currently interpretable in a relative or qualitative sense, rather than


being quantitatively aligned with known biological stressors. Future work could explore model


extensions that aim to separate different types of variation—such as stress type, intensity, or time


point—into distinct parts of the latent space. This may help make the model’s internal represen

tations more interpretable and biologically grounded, moving beyond abstract patterns to features


that align with real-world plant responses.


This work opens several promising avenues for future research and application. One key


direction is field deployment—by pairing DIVA with portable Raman spectrometers, it could en

able real-time stress monitoring in open farms and controlled environment agriculture, making it


a practical tool for precision agriculture. Beyond static assessment, DIVA could also be extended


to predictive modeling to predict stress trajectories, allowing early intervention before irreversible


damage occurs. Additionally, the adaptability of the DIVA framework opens the door to cross

species transfer; using transfer learning, DIVA could be fine-tuned for new crops with minimal


training data, thereby broadening its applicability across agricultural systems. Integration into digi

tal twinning frameworks is another compelling direction, where DIVA could contribute to real-time


automated plant health diagnostics in farming systems. Notably, the encoder-decoder architecture


of DIVA also allows the identification of previously unrecognized biomolecular patterns linked to


stress, potentially uncovering novel biological insights that go beyond existing knowledge.


25


The broader impact of this work spans multiple disciplines. For plant scientists, DIVA pro

vides a valuable analytical tool for studying latent physiological changes before the onset of visible


symptoms, allowing earlier detection and a deeper understanding of stress responses. For AI re

searchers, it serves as a proof-of-concept for the application of unbiased generative models to


uncover meaningful and interpretable biological insights from complex spectral data. From an


agricultural perspective, DIVA represents a scalable, non-intrusive, and cost-effective solution for


early stress detection, supporting more sustainable and precise crop management practices.


DIVA marks a step forward in the decoding of plant stress responses and in the monitoring


of plant health in general. By capturing and reconstructing Raman spectral features in an unsu

pervised and interpretable way, DIVA offers a robust, generalizable method for early and accurate


stress detection across plant species and conditions. DIVA’s flexibility, automation, and inter

pretability make it suitable for both scientific research and real-world agricultural deployment.


DIVA provides not only a tool, but also a framework for well-informed, data-driven crop resilience


strategies.

Methods


Raman acquisition system


The acquisition setup included a benchtop Raman spectrometer [5,15] with an excitation wave

length of 830 nm and laser power of 100 mW. The 830 nm excitation wavelength was particularly


chosen due to its deeper penetration depth and a comparatively lower fluorescence background sig

nal from the plant tissue, resulting in a higher signal-to-noise ratio Raman spectra [5] . Raman spectra


were acquired in the range 600-1750 cm [-1] . The acquisition time for each of the Raman spectra was


10 s. Raman spectra acquired from a polystyrene sample on the day of each experiment were used


as a reference to calibrate all the Raman spectra acquired from the plant samples on that particular


day.


Light stress study


To investigate light stress, 21-day-old soil-grown Arabidopsis, Choy Sum, and Kai Lan


plants were measured with Raman spectroscopy. The 14-day-old plants were subjected to 7


days of light stress before measurement by Raman spectroscopy. All plants were grown un

der control conditions before exposure to light stress. Arabidopsis plants were grown under


long-day photoperiod (LD, 16 h light:8 h dark), at 21 [o] C, and under white light of R:FR=3 and


PPFD=100 µmol m [-2] s [-1] . Choy Sum and Kai Lan were grown under LD, at 24 [o] C, and under white


light of R:FR=3 and PPFD=150 µmol m [-2] s [-1] . For Arabidopsis, plants were subjected to various


light conditions including white light that served as a control (R:FR=3, PPFD=100 µmol m [-2] s [-1] ),


high light (R:FR=3, PPFD=300 µmol m [-2] s [-1] ), low light (R:FR=3, PPFD=30 µmol m [-2] s [-1] ), and


shade (R:FR=0.1, PPFD=30 µmol m [-2] s [-1] ). Likewise, Choy Sum and Kai Lan plants were subjected


to light-stress conditions of white light (R:FR=3, PPFD=150 µmol m [-2] s [-1] ), high light (R:FR=3,


PPFD=600 µmol m [-2] s [-1] ), low light (R:FR=3, PPFD=30 µmol m [-2] s [-1] ), and shade (R:FR=0.1,


PPFD=30 µmol m [-2] s [-1] ). White light was supplied by SE-004 4000K white light LED tubes (Sys

27


tion Electronics, Portugal). Low R:FR was achieved by supplementing low-intensity white light


with far-red light from SE-004 FAR RED-730nm LED tubes (Systion Electronics, Portugal). Ra

man spectra were acquired on the leaf blades for all plant samples, specifically on the third true


leaf for Arabidopsis plants and the first true leaf for Choy Sum and Kai Lan plants, respectively.


Two acquisitions were made per leaf blade (one on each side of the main vein).


Shade avoidance stress study


For the case study on shade-avoidance stress, 17-day-old Arabidopsis plants grown in soil


were measured with Raman spectroscopy. Mutant plants phyA-211 and phyB-9 [BC] were included


along with the wildtype Arabidopsis plants for analysis. 10-day-old plants were subjected to var

ious growth conditions for 7 days, including white light that served as a control (WL, red:far-red


ratio (R:FR) of 3 and photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of 100 µmol m [-2] s [-1] ), moderate


shade (R:FR of 0.7 and PPFD of 60 µmol m [-2] s [-1] ), and deep shade (R:FR of 0.2 and PPFD of


30 µmol m [-2] s [-1] ). Raman spectra were acquired on the third true leaf, on the leaf blade, and on the


petiole. Two acquisitions were made per leaf blade (one on each side of the main vein) and one


acquisition was made for the petiole (at the middle of the petiole). More details regarding the plant


samples appear in our previous study [5] .


High-temperature stress study


For the high-temperature stress study, 21-day-old soil-grown Arabidopsis, Choy Sum, and


Kai Lan plants were measured with Raman spectroscopy. Arabidopsis, Choy Sum, and Kai Lan


plants were grown in the control condition (21 [o] C for Arabidopsis and 24 [o] C for Choy Sum and


Kai Lan) until subjected to their respective high temperature treatments. Arabidopsis plants were


subjected to high ambient temperature at 29 [o] C, while Choy Sum and Kai Lan were exposed to


33 [o] C. The plants were subjected to various high-temperature durations (0, 2, 4, 6 days) before


data acquisition. All plants were of the same age during data acquisition. Throughout the ex

28


periment, all plants were grown under LD photoperiod and white light condition (Arabidopsis:


R:FR=3, PPFD=100 µmol m [-2] s [-1] ; Choy Sum and Kai Lan: R:FR=3, PPFD=150 µmol m [-2] s [-1] ). Ra

man spectra were acquired on the leaf blade and the corresponding petiole of all the plant samples,


specifically on the third true leaf for Arabidopsis plants, and the first true leaf for Choy Sum and


Kai Lan plants. The data acquisitions for the stressed states were made on days 2, 4, and 6 post

induction of high-temperature stress. Five Raman spectra were obtained per acquisition. Two


acquisitions were made per leaf blade (one on each side of the main vein) and one acquisition was


made per petiole (middle of the petiole).


Bacterial stress study


For the case study on bacterial stress, Choy Sum plants for pathogen infection and Arabidop

sis plants for bacterial elicitation were considered.


Commercial Choy Sum (Brassica rapa var. parachinensis) seeds were germinated and


grown under controlled environmental conditions (25 [o] C, 75% humidity, 16h light/8h dark pho

toperiod, 230 µmol m [-2] s [-1] light intensity). Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc) isolate


(ATCC33913) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in YGC


medium (yeast extract, glucose, calcium carbonate) at 28 [o] C in a shaker incubator at 125 rpm.


Bacterial suspensions were prepared by resuspending cultures in fresh YGC to a final concentra

tion of 1×10 [8] CFU mL [-1] . Two-week-old plants were used for infiltration. The abaxial side of the


fourth true leaf was inoculated with bacterial suspension using a needleless syringe on either side


of the central vein near the apex margins. Control plants were mock-inoculated with sterile YGC


medium. All plants were maintained under identical growth conditions following treatment. Leaf


∼
discs ( 5 mm diameter) were collected from the proximal region of the infiltrated zone at 24 h and


48 h post-infiltration. From each disc, three positions were measured, acquiring five Raman spectra


per position (10 s exposure per spectrum). Thirty spectra per biological replicate were averaged to


29


generate a single representative Raman profile. Three biological replicates were collected for each


treatment and time point.


Arabidopsis plants were grown at 21 [o] C for 6 weeks and challenged with elf18 and flg22


bacterial elicitors. More details regarding the plant growth and elicitor/pathogen infiltration appear


in our previous study [15] . Raman spectra were acquired from the leaf blade discs harvested from the


infiltrated leaf in all the plant samples, specifically on the seventh or the eighth leaf for Arabidopsis


plants. The data acquisitions for the stressed states were made at 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h post

infiltration for the case of infection with bacterial elicitors.


Data preprocessing


Raw Raman spectra (I(v˜)) acquired via benchtop systems and, in some experiments, via


portable systems, were directly fed into the workflow as detailed in Fig. 1. No feature selection or


meticulous data preprocessing steps inclusive of smoothening and baseline removal were explicitly


performed for any of the data, as it would bias the training of the autoencoder. Spectral trimming


below 600 cm [-1] and above 1750 cm [-1] to exclude amplified emission effects caused by the incident


laser and removal of cosmic-ray noise were performed using BRAPH2DiSTAP software, a custom


fork of the BRAPH 2.0 software [28,29] . The BRAPH2DiSTAP software was developed and compiled


in MATLAB [®] v2023b. The spectra were normalized by reducing the original Raman intensities


because the values were too large for the neural network to train effectively. Without normalization,


the high intensities at the start of the wavenumber range would have caused an excessively large


loss at the beginning of training, making it harder for the model to converge. A first derivative


transformation was then applied to enable the encoder to capture relative trends in Raman intensity


changes.

D(˜v) = [dI][(] ˜ [v][˜][)] (1)

dv


where D(˜v) is the first derivative representation of an original Raman spectrum I(˜v), which serves


30


as a representative input to the encoder. The total dataset is then randomly divided, with ∼ 90%


allocated for training and ∼10% for testing, ensuring a robust evaluation of the VAE model per

formance.


Variational Autoencoder for Unsupervised Clustering


In this study, we employed a variational autoencoder (VAE) [30,31] to perform unsupervised


clustering based on local microenvironments, characterized by distinct Raman spectral descriptors.


These inherently latent descriptors were derived from A(v˜), which was evaluated at each peak


position of the characteristic Raman spectra derivative D(v˜). The VAE architecture enabled the


generation of a continuous and structured latent space of Raman spectral features, where each


point corresponded to a unique spectral signature [32] .


The VAE consisted of two main components: the encoder and the decoder. The encoder


network began with an input layer whose size matched the length of the input derivative spectrum


D(v˜). This was followed by a fully connected layer with 64 neurons and a Rectified Linear Unit


(ReLU) activation layer. A subsequent fully connected layer with 4 neurons fed into the sam

pling layer, concluding the encoder. The decoder network mirrored this structure with two fully


connected layers and included a Leaky ReLU activation layer with an alpha value of 1, allowing


linear activation for both positive and negative inputs. The sampling layer processed two vectors:


the mean vector µ and the log-variance vector log(σ [2] ). Elements were sampled from a normal


distribution N (µ i, σ i [2] [)][ using these vectors, with][ log(][σ] [2] [)][ included to enhance numerical stability]


during training. The VAE was trained to enforce a Gaussian distribution on the latent space, en

couraging smoothness and continuity in the learned representation. The training process used a


batch size of 40 over 3000 epochs with a learning rate of 10 [-3] . Optimization was driven by the


Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) loss function, which balances reconstruction accuracy and latent


space regularization. The ELBO loss comprises two main components: the reconstruction loss and


31


the Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence loss. The reconstruction loss was computed using the mean


absolute error (MAE) between the decoder’s output �xi and the original input xi, as shown:



reconstruction loss = [1]

N



N


�

� |x i − x i | (2)


i=1



where N represents the number of input variables.


The KL divergence loss measured the deviation of the learned latent variable distribution


from the standard normal distribution, ensuring that the latent space remained regularized and


generative:



KL loss = − [1]

2



M
�


i=1



�1 + log(σ i [2] [)][ −] [µ] [2] i [−] [σ] i [2] [)] � (3)



where M is the number of latent variables.


Together, these loss components formed the ELBO loss function, which was minimized to


train the VAE. Including the KL divergence term helped ensure that the clusters formed through the


reconstruction loss were tightly concentrated around the center of the latent space. This resulted in


a continuous and well-defined space for sampling and interpretation.


Training set sizes and Model execution times


For each case study, the DIVA model was trained on Raman spectral data collected under


different stress treatments and plant genotypes. To ensure robust evaluation, 90% of the data was


used for training, and results presented in the main figures are based on these training sets. The


remaining 10% was held out for testing and validation.


1. Light stress study This dataset included three species—Arabidopsis, Choy Sum, and Kai Lan—


exposed to four light conditions: high light, low light, white light, and deep shade. Spectra con

tained 871 Raman features. Arabidopsis: 160 spectra from 32 locations (5 replicates per location),


32


divided equally into 8 locations per light condition (4 leaves per condition, 2 locations per leaf).


Choy Sum: 150 spectra from 30 locations, with 8 locations each for high, low, and white light, and


6 for deep shade (2 locations per leaf). Kai Lan: 160 spectra from 32 locations, divided equally


across the 4 light conditions (8 locations per condition, 2 locations per leaf). Training time: ∼3–4


minutes.


2. Shade avoidance stress study This dataset focused on Arabidopsis genotypes responding to


shade. Each spectrum had 950 features. phyA-211 group: 100 spectra from 20 locations (5 repli

cates per location), with 6, 8, and 6 locations under deep shade, mild shade, and white light re

spectively (2 locations per leaf). phyB-9 [BC] group: 60 spectra from 12 locations, equally divided


across 3 light conditions. Wildtype group: 60 spectra from 12 locations, divided similarly across


conditions (2 locations per leaf). Training time: ∼2–3 minutes per model.

spectrum had 871 Raman features. Arabidopsis: 120 spectra from 24 locations, with 6 locations


per temperature condition (4 groups total). Choy Sum: 80 spectra from 16 locations, with 4 per


condition. Kai Lan: 80 spectra from 16 locations, with 4 per condition. Training time: ∼2–3


minutes per model.


4. Bacterial stress study (Pathogen-induced infection) This dataset analyzed Choy Sum leaves


infiltrated with a bacterial suspension or buffer. Each spectrum contained 839 Raman features.


24 hours post-infiltration: 225 spectra from 45 locations (5 replicates per location), with 25 for


buffer and 20 for infected group. 48 hours post-infiltration: 400 spectra from 80 locations, equally


divided into 40 locations per group. Training time: ∼3–4 minutes per time point.


5. Bacterial stress study (Elicitor-induced infection) This dataset involved Arabidopsis wild

type plants infiltrated with bacterial elicitors. Each spectrum contained 823 Raman features. Wild

type control group: 180 spectra from 36 locations (5 replicates per location), with 12 locations per


33


time point. elf18-infiltrated group: 180 spectra from 36 locations, with 12 per time point. flg22

infiltrated group: 180 spectra from 36 locations, with 12 per time point. Training time: ∼3 minutes


per group.


Model Execution Time Once trained, the DIVA model processed each study—including signifi

cant peak detection, latent space projection, and visualization—in approximately 3–5 seconds.


Significant Peaks Detection Methodology


The detection of significant peaks in the stressed state of a plant was achieved using a zero

crossing analysis implemented in MATLAB. The process identified mainly two types of zero

crossing events within the input signal array D(v˜), sampled at corresponding indices: positive-to

negative zero-crossings and general zero-crossings. For each type, crossing points were computed


using linear interpolation at a zero threshold. Specifically, the function for positive-to-negative


zero-crossings returned indices (ind ~~p~~ 2n), interpolated crossing times (t0 ~~p~~ 2n), and signal values at


the crossing points (s0 ~~p~~ 2n). Similar computations were performed for all zero-crossings resulting


in ind, t0, s0 respectively.


To quantify the significance of peaks, the area under the graph surrounding each positive

to-negative zero-crossing was calculated. For each such crossing index, the area was computed


as the sum of the absolute signal values between the immediately preceding and succeeding zero

crossing points. To handle boundary conditions, incomplete peak regions at the start and end of


the spectrum that lacked valid neighboring zero-crossings were discarded, ensuring only complete


and interpretable peak regions were considered. The resulting area values were stored in an array,


representing an estimate of the biomolecular concentration at the site of Raman signal acquisition.


The identified peaks were compiled into a matrix, sig ~~p~~ ks, which included the zero-crossing


times (t0 ~~p~~ 2n), their corresponding rounded indices, and the computed area values. For ranking

purposes, the peaks were sorted in descending order based on their area-under-the-graph values.


This ranking yielded a matrix containing the sorted zero-crossing times, rounded indices, and area

under-the-graph values. This final step facilitated the prioritization of peaks, emphasizing the most


significant features of the stressed state of the plant.


Hardware for accelerated evaluation


An Nvidia RTX 4080 was used for the GPU workload while training the variational auto

encoder models. The CPU used is an Intel [®] Core [TM] 14th Gen i9 14900KF. 64GB DDR5 RAM


was employed for all model calculations pertinent to training and evaluation. The training was per

formed on this set of hardware running Windows 11 Pro (x64) with no other foreground programs


running when training was conducted.

Fig. 1: Deep learning-based Investigation of Vibrational Raman spectra for plant-stress
Analysis (DIVA). a, Raw Raman spectra, I(v˜), collected by a Raman spectrometer, capture
biomolecular fingerprints of plants at specific times. b-c, Standard Raman signal processing requires baseline estimation (b) and removal from the raw spectra (c). d-h, In the proposed modelfree approach, the raw Raman spectra are differentiated (d) and fed to a variational autoencoder
(VAE). The VAE encoder (e) is trained to map the differentiated spectra into points in a lowdimensional latent space (f). For each plant condition (e.g., healthy or stressed), the VAE decoder
(g) can reconstruct the average latent space of the characteristic differentiated spectra, D(v˜) (h).
Differences between the average characteristic differentiated spectra reveal the spectral traits characteristic of each plant condition (e.g., healthy vs. stressed states). i, The zero-crossings in the
decoded characteristic differentiated spectra identify the Raman peaks whose significance can be
inferred from the area under the graph, A(v˜).
