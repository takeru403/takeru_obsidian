## Abstract


Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites with giant piezoelectric responses, exemplified by TMCM

CdCl 3, represent a promising platform for flexible and environmentally friendly electromechanical


materials. However, the microscopic origin of such exceptional performance in this weakly polar


system has remained elusive. Here, using deep-learning-assisted large-scale molecular dynamics


simulations, we resolve this paradox by reproducing the experimentally measured piezoelectric


coefficient _d_ 33 _≈_ 220 pC/N, and demonstrating that the giant response arises from the collective


contribution of multiple intrinsic components, particularly the shear component _d_ 15 . This effect


does not stem from conventional polarization rotation or phase switching, but instead originates


from stochastic 120 _[◦]_ in-plane rotational hopping of a small fraction of organic cations. This discrete


hopping mechanism is governed by the local C 3 -symmetric halogen-bonding network between the


host framework and the guest cation. The Arrhenius-type temperature dependence of _d_ 15 further


confirms the role of thermally activated dipole hopping. This work provides a clear pathway to


enhance piezoelectric performance of hybrid materials through rational engineering of host–guest


interactions.

Piezoelectric materials, which can convert mechanical energy into electrical energy and


vice versa, are foundational to a wide range of modern technologies, from ultrasound to


advanced sensors [1]. For decades, this technological landscape has been dominated by inor

–
ganic ferroelectrics such as barium titanate (BTO) and lead zirconate titanate (PZT) [2 6].


While these materials offer robust performance, they also present notable drawbacks: they


are heavy, brittle, require high-temperature processing, and often contain toxic elements,


making them unsuitable for emerging applications that demand flexible, lightweight, and


biocompatible piezoelectrics. This has driven a search for molecular alternatives, which


promise mechanical flexibility and environmentally friendly solution-processability, but have


historically been limited by a fundamental trade-off: molecular ferroelectrics tend to exhibit


–
low spontaneous polarization, leading to weak piezoelectric response [7 11].


The discovery of the hybrid organic-inorganic ferroelectric perovskite trimethylchloromethyl


ammonium trichlorocadmium(II) [Me 3 NCH 2 ClCdCl 3, (TMCM-CdCl 3 )], composed of or

ganic TMCM [+] cations and inorganic CdCl _[−]_ 3 [frameworks, marks an important advance-]


ment [12]. Exhibiting a giant piezoelectric coefficient, it challenges the long-standing trade

off typically associated with molecular ferroelectrics. This breakthrough opens up new


opportunities for developing flexible, low-temperature-processable piezoelectric materials.


However, it also presents a fundamental paradox: despite having a spontaneous polariza

tion of only 4–5 _µ_ C/cm [2], an order of magnitude smaller than that of BTO ( _≈_ 25 _µ_ C/cm [2] ),


TMCM-CdCl 3 achieves a piezoelectric strain coefficient of _d_ 33 _≈_ 220 pC/N, comparable


to BTO. The striking anomaly of a weakly polar material exhibiting a giant piezoelectric


response suggests the presence of an unconventional physical mechanism.


Two primary theories have been proposed to resolve the paradox of giant piezoelectricity


in weakly polar TMCM-based perovskites. The original study suggested a ferroelastic polar

ization rotation mechanism [12]. Crystallographic and vector piezoresponse force microscopy


analyses revealed that monoclinic TMCM-CdCl 3 hosts twelve energetically equivalent polar


states. It was argued that applied stress could trigger ferroelastic switching between these


states, causing a large-angle reorientation of the polarization vector and, consequently, a


giant piezoelectric response. A key limitation of this theory is that reversible ferroelastic


switching, essential for reversible piezoelectricity, often requires alternating compressive and


tensile stress, a condition not typically met during standard unipolar piezoelectric measure

ments. A later theoretical study proposed a phase-switching mechanism [13]. First-principles


2


calculations identified a metastable phase featuring TMCM [+] cations in head-to-head and


tail-to-tail orientations. The piezoelectric response was attributed to a stress-induced tran

sition between this phase and the ground-state monoclinic structure. This theory was based


on static, zero-Kelvin unit-cell calculations that neglect thermal fluctuations and collective


dipole dynamics, factors likely crucial to understanding the experimental behavior at finite


temperatures and in mesoscale systems.


Here, we resolve this long-standing puzzle using large-scale molecular dynamics (MD)


simulations of TMCM-CdCl 3, enabled by a high-fidelity machine-learning force field trained


exclusively on first-principles data. By computing the full piezoelectric tensor in the single

domain limit at 300 K, we show that the experimentally observed giant response is dominated


not by the intrinsic longitudinal coefficient _d_ 33, but by large shear components, particularly


_d_ 15 = 163 pC/N. Notably, applying a proper tensor transformation from the crystal to


the laboratory frame yields an effective _d_ [eff] 33 [of 212 pC/N at 300 K, closely matching the]


experimental value of 220 pC/N. We uncover a novel piezoelectric mechanism distinct from


both ferroelastic and phase switching: a stress-driven, thermally-activated stochastic 120 _[◦]_


rotational hopping of a small fraction of TMCM [+] cations. This hopping is governed by


the local C 3 symmetry imposed by the halogen bonds between organic cations and the


inorganic framework. As long as the fraction of hopped cations remains below a critical


threshold, they can return to their original states once the stress is removed, exhibiting a


shape-memory-like effect. This collective, reversible dipole hopping underlies the observed


reversible piezoelectricity, further supported by the strong temperature dependence of the


response. Finally, we distinguish this useful, reversible behavior from the irreversible, large

strain ferroelastic switching that defines the material’s fatigue limit. Our results provide a


comprehensive picture of piezoelectricity in TMCM-CdCl 3 and similar hybrid perovskites,


offering key insights for further improving electromechanical responses in these materials.


Previous studies have shown that TMCM-CdCl 3 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group


_Cc_ in the ferroelectric phase and the hexagonal space group _P_ 6 3 _/mmc_ in the paraelectric


phase. Despite several DFT-based investigations, the connection between the collective


orientations of molecular dipoles associated with TMCM [+] cations and the macroscopic po

–
larization remains controversial in literature [13 15]. We introduce an intuitive host-guest


framework to clarify this relationship. As depicted in Fig. 1a, one-dimensional CdCl _[−]_ 3 [chains,]


the “host,” self-assemble into a triangular lattice, forming triangular channels along the


3


[001] direction. The functional “guests” are organic TMCM [+] cations, which reside within


these channels and form their own A-B stacked triangular sub-lattices. In the paraelectric


phase, the molecular cations are fully disordered, yielding a primitive hexagonal unit cell.


In contrast, the ferroelectric phase features alignment of the out-of-plane components of all


molecular dipoles (Fig. 1b). However, a previously underappreciated detail is that, while


dipoles within each layer are aligned, adjacent layers of dipoles are not fully co-aligned, as


seen in the side view (Fig. 1b) and top-down view (Fig. 1c). We find that the orientation


of each TMCM [+] cation is anchored by highly directional CH 3 –Cl _· · ·_ Cl halogen bonds (see


dashed lines in Fig. 1b-c), which act as a “molecular lock” connecting the guest cation to


the surrounding inorganic chains. This interaction restricts the cation to one of three ener

getically equivalent orientations, with its intrinsic (in-plane) dipole pointing toward an edge


of the triangular channel. The helical arrangement of Cl atoms along the CdCl _[−]_ 3 [chains]


therefore prevents full dipole alignment across layers.


Since the unit cell of the ferroelectric phase contains two layers of molecular dipoles,


the in-plane component of the total polarization can be intuitively understood using the


schematic in Fig. 1f, which represents each dipole layer as a triangle, with the two triangles


rotated 180° relative to each other to reflect the stacking arrangement. The six macroscopic


polar variants along the [102] and other crystallographically equivalent directions, illustrated


in Fig. 1d, correspond to distinct combinations of allowed relative orientations between


the two layers of TMCM [+] cations within the unit cell. As discussed in detail below, the


restricted molecular dipole orientations, governed by the C 3 symmetry, play a key role in


the piezoelectric response.


Theoretical prediction of finite-temperature piezoelectric coefficients in hybrid materials


such as TMCM-CdCl 3 is challenging, as conventional approaches such as density functional


perturbation theory often yield negligible values [13, 16]. This limitation likely arises from


the neglect of thermal fluctuations and the associated order–disorder behavior of molecular


dipoles. To overcome this challenge, we developed a deep neural network-based interatomic


potential (deep potential, or DP [17, 18]), which enables large-scale MD simulations of


TMCM-CdCl 3 at finite temperatures. It can also directly predict total polarization from


atomic positions. Our model demonstrates high fidelity across a wide range of validation


tests. It achieves an excellent fit to the reference DFT database, with low mean absolute


errors (MAEs) for energy (0.214 meV/atom), force (0.017 eV/ [˚] A), virial (1.609 meV/atom),


4


and polarization (0.06 _µ_ C _/_ cm [2] ). The model accurately reproduces static properties, in

cluding the equation of state and elastic moduli, and captures key dynamic and finite

temperature phenomena, such as the energy barrier for in-plane TMCM [+] cation rotation


and the temperature-driven ferroelectric-to-paraelectric phase transition (see Supplementary


–
Material for details, [19 31]). The piezoelectric tensor element is calculated as _d_ _ij_ = ∆ _P_ _i_ _/σ_ _j_,


reflecting the polarization change along direction _i_ (∆ _P_ _i_ ) due to an applied stress with com

ponent _j_ ( _σ_ _j_ in Voigt notation).


We now explain the calculation of _d_ 15 (with indices defined relative to the monoclinic


unit cell) in detail. A shear deformation is imposed by varying the lattice angle _β_ by


an amount ∆ _β_ (Fig. 2a inset), while allowing all other lattice parameters to fully relax


during finite-temperature MD simulations with _β_ held fixed, using a 10,800-atom supercell.


At equilibrium, only the shear stress component _σ_ 5 is nonzero, establishing a one-to-one


relationship among ∆ _β_, _σ_ 5, and _P_ 1 . The evolution of _P_ 1 and _σ_ 5 as a function of ∆ _β_ at


300 K is shown in Fig. 2, along with dipole density plots that illustrate the distributions of


in-plane molecular dipole orientations within the supercell. The starting polar state I has


a net in-plane polarization along the [100] direction ( _P_ 1 _≈−_ 4 _µ_ C/cm [2] ). As shear strain


is applied, the shear stress _σ_ 5 increases in magnitude, while all other stress components


( _σ_ _j_, _j ̸_ = 5) remain negligible (Fig. 2b). This confirms that in MD simulations, the system


reaches mechanical equilibrium under the constraint of fixed ∆ _β_, with _σ_ 5 representing the


balanced internal stress required to maintain the imposed deformation. The microstructural


evolution under shear is revealed by the dipole density plots (Fig. 2f). In the strained state


II, MD simulations show that dipoles do not rotate uniformly. Instead, a subset of molecular


dipoles undergo 120 _[◦]_ hops into adjacent symmetry-equivalent potential wells. These locally


reoriented dipoles act as “orientational defects” embedded within the original domain [15].


Notably, the shear stress _σ_ 5 reaches its maximum value, _σ_ 5 _[t]_ [, at a critical shear deformation]


∆ _β_ _[t]_ _≈_ 2 _._ 8°, marking the threshold for piezoelectric reversibility. State II lies just below this


threshold. When the stress is removed, the system relaxes to state II _[′]_ (see Fig. 2f), which


is nearly identical to the initial state I. This indicates that dipoles return to their original


orientations via reverse 120 _[◦]_ hopping, resulting in a fully reversible piezoelectric response.


In contrast, when the applied shear strain exceeds the threshold (∆ _β >_ ∆ _β_ _[t]_ ), the system


transitions to a fundamentally different configuration, represented by state III, characterized


by a more isotropic distribution of in-plane dipole orientations. After unloading, the system


5


relaxes to state III _[′]_, where dipoles occupy four symmetry-related wells, clearly distinct from


the initial state I. These results demonstrate that the critical stress _σ_ 5 _[t]_ [associated with ∆] _[β]_ _[t]_


defines the limit for reversible piezoelectric switching. We thus define the reversible shear


piezoelectric coefficient as _d_ 15 = ∆ _P_ 1 _[t]_ _[/σ]_ 5 _[t]_ [= 163 pC/N.]

Table I presents the intrinsic piezoelectric tensor, calculated in the single-crystal, single

domain limit at 300 K using the method described above. Interestingly, the longitudinal


component _d_ 33 is relatively low at 14 pC/N, while the components _d_ 15 = 163 pC/N and


_d_ 11 = 77 pC/N are significantly larger in magnitude. This indicates that stress applied along


the crystallographic _c_ -axis induces minimal polarization change, reflecting the structural


rigidity of the CdCl _[−]_ 3 [inorganic chains.]


Experimentally, as-grown ferroelectric monoclinic TMCM-CdCl 3 thin films typically


adopt the (110) orientation [or the equivalent (100) orientation in the paraelectric phase] [32].


As a result, the stress applied along the film normal direction, denoted _σ_ _[Z]_ (aligned with the


laboratory _Z_ -axis), does not coincide with the crystallographic _c_ -axis. Consequently, the


effective piezoelectric coefficient measured along _Z_, _d_ [eff] 33 [, reflects a combination of multiple]


components of the intrinsic piezoelectric tensor. To quantitatively connect the intrinsic


response to the experimental geometry, we perform a tensor rotation to identify the relative


orientation between the stress along the film normal and polarization direction that maxi

mizes _d_ [eff] 33 [. We find that] _[ d]_ [eff] 33 [reaches a value of 211 pC/N when] _[ σ]_ _[Z]_ [ is nearly orthogonal to]


[0 [¯] 12] or [01 [¯][¯] 2] polarization vectors (see schematic in Fig. S7), in excellent agreement with


the experimentally measured value of 220 pC/N.


The origin of the enhanced effective response, exceeding that of any single intrinsic com

ponent, can be understood as follows. Due to the relative freedom of molecular cations in


6


the host–guest framework of TMCM-CdCl 3, The polarization vector does not align with


any of the unit cell’s crystallographic axes in the ferroelectric monoclinic phase. This


anisotropy allows _σ_ _[Z]_ to project onto multiple stress components in the crystal frame:


_σ_ _[Z]_ = 0 _._ 5 _σ_ 1 + 0 _._ 4 _σ_ 3 + 0 _._ 5 _σ_ 5 . As a result, the effective response includes weighted contri

butions from several intrinsic tensor elements, specifically _d_ 11, _d_ 13, _d_ 15, _d_ 31, _d_ 33, and _d_ 35,


which collectively yield the giant piezoelectric response of 211 pC/N. We find that _d_ 15 and


_d_ 11 account for about 60% and 20% of _d_ [eff] 33 [, respectively.]


The excellent agreement between theory and experiment not only validates our finite

temperature MD-based approach for computing the intrinsic piezoelectric tensor, but also


provides microscopic insights into the origin of the giant response. Microscopically, the


giant piezoelectric response of TMCM-CdCl 3 primarily arises from stress-driven, symmetry

governed stochastic hopping of molecular dipoles by 120 _[◦]_ . Crucially, only a small subset of


local dipoles are activated, ensuring a reversible mechanical response. This gives rise to a


macroscopically small-angle rotation of the net polarization vector. As shown in Fig. 2e,


∆ _β_ _[t]_ corresponds to a maximum rotation of global polarization by approximately 14 _[◦]_, sig

nificantly smaller than previously proposed values (56 _[◦]_ ) [13], setting this mechanism apart


from the conventional polarization rotation mechanism [33]. Importantly, this behavior


occurs without any phase transition, in contrast to earlier interpretations [12, 13].


Since the piezoelectric response of TMCM-CdCl 3 is governed by the stochastic hopping


of molecular dipoles, a process inherently influenced by thermal fluctuations, we expect the


piezoelectric coefficients to exhibit strong temperature dependence. To investigate this, we


construct _σ_ 5 –∆ _β_ curves at various temperatures ranging from 200 K to 350 K (Fig. 3a).


–
From these, we derive the corresponding ∆ _P_ 1 _σ_ 5 curves (Fig. 3b). At each temperature, the


shear piezoelectric coefficient _d_ 15 is estimated using the relation _d_ 15 = ∆ _P_ 1 _[t]_ _[/σ]_ 5 _[t]_ [. As expected,]


_d_ 15 shows a pronounced temperature dependence, increasing from 6 pC/N at 200 K to a giant


value of 823 pC/N at 350 K. We find that this temperature dependence follows an Arrhenius

type relationship: plotting ln _d_ 15 against 1 _/T_ yields a clear linear trend. The slope of this


line corresponds to an activation energy ( _E_ _a_ ) of 0.18 eV, which agrees well with the 0.21 eV


rotational barrier for TMCM [+] cations obtained from DFT calculations (see Fig. S3). The


Arrhenius-type temperature dependence of the piezoelectric response demonstrates that the


giant effect in TMCM-CdCl 3 at room temperatures arises from a dynamic process governed


by thermally activated hopping of molecular dipoles over an energy barrier.


7


As discussed above, a large applied stress can induce an irreversible structural trans

formation when the shear distortion exceeds ∆ _β_ _[t]_ . The turnover in the stress–strain curve


beyond ∆ _β_ _[t]_ reflects a stress-relaxation process (Fig. 2a), conceptually analogous to plastic


deformation in metals. MD simulations reveal that this relaxation occurs through the hop

ping of molecular dipoles, leading to the formation of “orientational defects,” which play a


similar role to dislocation defects in metals that enable plasticity [34]. This analogy mo

tivates further exploration of the mechanical response of TMCM-CdCl 3 under large shear


stress or strain, which could define the material’s operational limit.


Figure 4a presents the full stress-strain curve, corresponding to an in-plane 180° ferroe

lastic switching event, as the monoclinic angle _β_ is swept from 94.3° to 85.7°. During this


transition, the stress passes through a local minimum at _β ≈_ 90°, which corresponds to


an intermediate state characterized by a nearly in-plane isotropic distribution of molecular


dipole orientations. Once the switching is complete, the molecular dipoles have exhausted


all available hopping pathways. Consequently, further applied strain can only be accommo

dated by elastic lattice distortion, causing the stress to rise sharply and linearly, a regime


–
we refer to as the “elastic region.” In the corresponding _P_ 1 _σ_ 5 curve shown in Fig. 4b, we


can define another critical stress, _σ_ 5 _[∗]_ [, which is the] _[ minimum]_ [ stress required to complete the]


ferroelelastic switching process. Assuming a quasi-equilibrium process driven by _σ_ 5 _[∗]_ [, the sys-]


tem eventually equilibrates in the elastic region when the internal stress balances _σ_ 5 _[∗]_ [. This]


allows us to define an effective piezoelectric coefficient associated with ferroelastic switching:


_d_ _[∗]_ 15 [= ∆] _[P]_ _[ ∗]_ 1 _[/σ]_ 5 _[∗]_ [= 793 pC/N.]


However, we note that this ultrahigh response is a one-time effect under a unipolar stress


condition. After unloading, the system relaxes to the + _P_ 1 _[s]_ [state (Fig.][ 4][ inset). Subsequent]


stress application in the same direction will only operate within the elastic regime, yielding


a negligible piezoelectric response. This irreversible ferroelastic switching thus acts as a


fatigue mechanism, explaining how a sample could be rendered piezoelectrically inactive if


driven beyond its reversible, intrinsic limit. That said, if ferroelastic switching could be


harnessed in a reversible fashion, for example, through domain wall engineering, then the


piezoelectric response of TMCM-CdCl 3 could potentially be enhanced by over 350%.


In summary, using finite-temperature, large-scale molecular dynamics simulations en

abled by first-principles-based machine-learning force field, we have developed a robust


approach to compute the full piezoelectric tensor for organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites


8


represented by TMCM-CdCl 3 . This method captures key anharmonic effects associated


with the thermally driven order–disorder behavior of molecular dipoles. We reproduce


experimental giant piezoelectric coefficient, demonstrating that the effect is dominated by


intrinsic components like _d_ 15 and _d_ 11, which arise from stochastic in-plane hopping of molec

ular dipoles. This hopping is not random: the local C 3 -symmetric halogen-bonding network


between TMCM [+] cations and the inorganic host framework creates a rotational potential


energy landscape with three symmetry-equivalent minima. The Arrhenius-type temperature


dependence of the piezoelectric coefficients further corroborates the critical role of dipole


hopping. The mechanism of discrete, localized hopping is fundamentally different from the


continuous, bulk polarization rotation that drives the response in conventional piezoceramics


like PZT near a morphotropic phase boundary [33, 35]. Importantly, the reversibility of the


piezoelectric response in TMCM-CdCl 3 also relies on the activation of only a small subset of


molecular dipoles. We also identify in-plane 180 _[◦]_ ferroelastic switching as both a potential


fatigue mechanism and a promising route to further enhance the electromechanical response


if rendered reversible. Our work underscores the potential of engineering host–guest halogen


bonds to precisely tailor the rotational energy landscape of molecular dipoles for improved


performance.

FIG. 1. **Crystal structure and polarization varients of TMCM-CdCl** 3 **.** (a) Schematic


illustration of the host–guest framework in TMCM-CdCl 3 . One-dimensional inorganic CdCl _[−]_ 3


chains form a triangular lattice, with organic TMCM [+] cations occupying the interstitial sites to


create A–B stacked triangular sub-lattices. The crystallographic axes and directions shown are


defined with respect to the paraelectric hexagonal lattice. (b) Side view and (c) top view of the


crystal structure in the ferroelectric phase. The dashed triangle indicates the local triple-well


potential energy surface associated with the in-plane rotation of a TMCM [+] cation, which exhibits


C 3 symmetry. In this phase, molecules are anchored by highly directional CH 3 –Cl _· · ·_ Cl halogen


bonds (gray dashed lines). Due to the helical arrangement of Cl atoms along the CdCl _[−]_ chain,


the molecular dipoles in adjacent layers are not fully aligned. (d) Six equivalent macroscopic


polarization directions in the ferroelectric phase, each with different in-plane components. (f)


Schematics showing the collective in-plane orientations of molecular dipoles corresponding to the


six polar variants in (d). Yellow and blue triangles represent the two dipole layers within the unit


cell as shown in (b) and (c), and red arrows denote the net in-plane polarization.

FIG. 2. **Shear stress-induced reversible giant piezoelectric response via molecular**


**dipole hopping.** (a) Evolution of the polarization component along [100], _P_ 1, and (b) shear stress


_σ_ 5 as a function of shear strain ∆ _β_ . The inset in (a) illustrates the initial state I, characterized by


a monoclinic unit cell with in-plane polarization aligned along [ [¯] 100]. The shear strain is imposed


by varying the lattice angle _β_ while allowing all other lattice parameters to relax. MD simulations


ensure that for a fixed ∆ _β_, all other stress components ( _σ_ _j_, _j ̸_ = 5) remain negligible, as confirmed


in (b). The shear stress _σ_ 5 reaches a maximum at a critical strain ∆ _β_ _[t]_ . (c) Polarization change


∆ _P_ 1 as a function of _σ_ 5, derived from (a) and (b). (d) In-plane dipole orientation density plot for


TMCM [+] cations in the initial state I, following the schematic in Fig. 1. (e) Reversible region for


°
the rotation of the macroscopic polarization. ∆ _β_ _t_ corresponds to a small rotational angle of 14 _._ 28 .


(f) Dipole orientation density plots for strained states II and III, and their corresponding relaxed


configurations after unloading (II _[′]_ and III _[′]_ ). The transition between states I and II is reversible,


while the transition from I to III is irreversible as III _[′]_ is different from I.

FIG. 3. **Temperature-dependent piezoelectric response of TMCM-CdCl** 3 . (a) Shear


stress–strain curves obtained from MD simulations at temperatures ranging from 200 K to 350 K.


Solid lines represent polynomial fits to the simulation data. (b) Corresponding polarization change


∆ _P_ 1 as a function of applied shear stress _σ_ 5 at each temperature. The piezoelectric coefficient


_d_ 15 is extracted from the reversible response region, indicated by solid markers. (c) Temperature


dependence of _d_ 15 . (d) Arrhenius plot of ln _d_ 15 versus 1 _/T_, with the dashed line indicating a linear


fit. The slope yields an activation energy of _E_ _a_ = 0 _._ 18 eV.

FIG. 4. **Ferroelastic switching driven by large shear stress.** (a) Shear stress–strain


curve corresponding to a full reversal of in-plane polarization ( _−P_ 1 _[s]_ _[→]_ [+] _[P]_ 1 _[ s]_ [) driven by shear]


stress _σ_ 5 . Insets illustrate the in-plane orientations of molecular dipoles during the switching


process. The stress exhibits a characteristic increase followed by a decrease, reminiscent of the


plastic deformation behavior observed in metals. An intermediate state near _β ≈_ 90 _[◦]_ shows a


nearly isotropic distribution of in-plane dipoles. Upon completing the switching, the system enters


an elastic regime where stress increases linearly with strain. (b) Hysteresis loop showing the


relationship between shear stress _σ_ 5 and polarization _P_ 1 during the switching process in (a). The


maximum stress _σ_ 5 _[∗]_ [defines the threshold required to complete the ferroelastic switching.] The


corresponding maximum (irreversible) piezoelectric response is estimated as _d_ _[∗]_ 15 [= ∆] _[P]_ _[ ∗]_ 1 _[/σ]_ 5 _[∗]_ [.]
