**Abstract**


Climate sensitivity has remained stubbornly uncertain since the Charney Report was published
some 45 years ago. Two factors in future climate projections could alter this dilemma: (i) an

increased ratio of CO 2 forcing relative to aerosol cooling, owing to both continued accumulation
of CO 2 and declining aerosol emissions, and (ii) a warming world, whereby CO 2 -induced warming

becomes more pronounced relative to climate variability. Here, we develop a novel modeling approach

to explore the rates of learning about equilibrium climate sensitivity and the transient climate
response (TCR) and identify the physical drivers underpinning these learning rates. Our approach

has the advantage over past work by accounting for the full spectrum of parameter uncertainties and

covariances, while also taking into account serially correlated internal climate variability. Moreover,

we provide a physical explanation of how quickly we may hope to learn about climate sensitivity.

We find that, although we are able to constrain future TCR regardless of the true underlying value,

constraining ECS is more difficult, with low values of ECS being more easily ascertained than high

values. This asymmetry can be explained by most of the warming this century being attributable

to the fast climate mode, which is more useful for constraining TCR than it is for ECS. We further

show that our inability to constrain the deep ocean response is what limits our ability to learn high

values of ECS.

### **1 Introduction**


Broadly speaking, climate sensitivity relates the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) to the


amount of global average warming that will result on various timescales. Climate sensitivity can

be more precisely defined depending on the timescale under consideration. On long timescales (e.g.,


centuries or more), one often considers the equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS), which quantifies the


equilibrium amount of warming that would result from a doubling of atmospheric CO 2 relative to


pre-industrial times. On near-term timescales (e.g., years to decades), the transient climate response


(TCR) is more common, which quantifies the warming at the point where CO 2 has doubled in a


simulation where CO 2 is increased by 1% each year and the physical climate has not yet reached


equilibrium (Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change (IPCC), 2023).


Though each of these measures of the climate response have qualitative differences, they share a


common characteristic of being uncertain owing to the stochasticity and complexity of the climate


system. At the most basic level, the uncertain nature of climate sensitivity, regardless of its precise


definition, is the foundation of climate risk, making climate sensitivity a metric of substantive impor

tance in climate policy (Broecker, 1987; Barnett et al., 2020; Bauer et al., 2024b). It immediately


follows that any reduction in uncertainty in each of these sensitivity measures will result improved


decision-making and, hopefully, cost-savings for policymakers formulating carbon dioxide abatement


policy (Hope et al., 1993).


Frustratingly, narrowing uncertainty in climate sensitivity, regardless of the timescale, has remained


a major challenge, with the “likely” range for ECS not narrowing significantly since the Charney Report


published in the 1970s (National Research Council, 1979; Roe and Baker, 2007; Sherwood et al., 2020;


Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change (IPCC), 2023). One reason for this is the signal of climate


change – that is, CO 2 -induced warming relative to preindustrial – has not been present for long enough


in the observational record to place a strong constraint on ECS (Proistosescu and Huybers, 2017).


Another is that this signal is confounded by a number of factors; the main factor is aerosols that have a


very uncertain cooling effect on the global climate, offsetting some amount of CO 2 warming and making


the task of ascertaining how much of the current climate signal is attributable to CO 2 difficult (Knutti


et al., 2002).


The utility of the observational record in constraining the distribution of climate sensitivity has


thus far been limited. In its sixth assessment report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change


(IPCC) took a multi-pronged approach to constraining climate sensitivity, combining observations,


coupled climate models, paleoclimate records, simplified climate emulators, and emergent constraints


in a Bayesian framework (Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change (IPCC), 2023). Within the


context of this estimation framework, the observationally-inferred historical energy budget provides a


2


strong constraint on the low end of ECS, but did not meaningfully constrain the high end of the ECS


distribution (Sherwood et al., 2020). This is because of both the state-dependence of climate feedbacks


on the pattern of global warming (Zhou et al., 2017; Dong et al., 2019) and the confounding effects of


aerosol emissions. The historical observational record can be used to indirectly constrain the high end


of the ECS distribution via climate model weighting schemes that down-weight climate models that


are ‘too hot’ in the historical record and generally have unrealistically high ECS values (Knutti, 2010;


Liang et al., 2020; Tokarska, 2020; Ribes et al., 2021; Hausfather et al., 2022; McDonnell et al., 2024),


but these approaches usually only constrain the extreme tail of the ECS distribution.


However, two socio-economic trends could break the current stalemate in narrowing climate sensi

tivity uncertainty using observations. Each of these trends would increase the CO 2 -induced warming


signal-to-noise ratio, making climate sensitivity, in principle, easier to ascertain. First, a widespread


trend of increasingly stringent air quality laws have caused steady declines in aerosol emissions over the


last several decades (US Environmental Protection Agency Office of Air and Radiation, 2011); indeed,


almost all of the shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs) project declining aerosol emissions into the


future (Riahi et al., 2017). This implies that, if future air quality laws become more stringent, less


CO 2 -induced warming will be masked by the cooling effect of aerosols, thus increasing the signal-to

noise ratio of CO 2 -attributable warming. The second factor is that as more CO 2 is emitted, the signal


of CO 2 warming will become more pronounced relative to internal climate variability, making the sig

nal of climate change more easily discernible and bolstering our ability to constrain climate sensitivity


using new observations.


Another important consideration relates to which climate sensitivity parameter one hopes to learn.


On the one hand, because the characteristic timescales of the climate system’s thermal response can


exceed two hundred years (Geoffroy et al., 2013a; Leach et al., 2021), near-term warming information


is likely to be of limited use in improving our estimates of ECS (as the “slow” mode of warming will


not be manifest for perhaps hundreds of years). On the other hand, improving our estimates of TCR


may yet be possible, as the near-term scope of TCR makes near-term warming information potentially


useful, especially in light of the two projected socio-economic trends mentioned above. This important


dynamic trade-off between when the short- and long-term timescales of warming manifest was explored


by Roe and Baker (2007) and Baker and Roe (2009).


Past studies have used synthetic future observations of the climate, either generated with an energy


balance model (EBM) or general circulation models (GCM), to constrain estimates of climate sensitivity


3


using Bayesian frameworks (Kelly and Kolstad, 1999; Leach, 2007; Padilla et al., 2011; Ring and


Schlesinger, 2012; Urban et al., 2014; Kelly and Tan, 2015; Mori and Shiogama, 2018). Although the


specifics of each framework in the literature varies, a common thread is to jointly estimate a subset of


the EBM parameter space (e.g., joint uncertainty in the climate feedback, ocean diffusivity, and the


sensitivity of aerosol forcing, as done in Ring and Schlesinger (2012)) to estimate a “learning rate”


of climate sensitivity once future observations are incorporated into the assimilation window. Most


studies find that learning about climate sensitivity is possible by the end of the century, although


some suggest that uncertainty may widen before it begins to narrow (Hannart et al., 2013). Another


study focused on projecting the decline in anthropogenic radiative forcing uncertainty to constraint


the TCR uncertainty, finding that TCR uncertainty could be reduced by as much as 50% in the


near future (Myhre et al., 2015). Finally, the Allen, Stott and Kettleborough (ASK) method (Allen


et al., 2000; Stott and Kettleborough, 2002; Gillett et al., 2012; Stott et al., 2013) has been used to


constrain future temperature rise conditional on sequentially assimilated observations, but a recent


application did not explicitly tie narrowing uncertainty in temperature rise to learning about the


underlying distribution of ECS or TCR (Shiogama et al., 2016).


While the above studies have shed light on the rate at which we narrow uncertainty in climate


sensitivity (which we coin “climate sensitivity learning rates” throughout), they share a number of


limitations. First, current state-of-the-art simplified EBMs (such as FaIR (Leach et al., 2021) or


MAGICC (Meinshausen et al., 2011) that are used in the IPCC’s estimation methodology mentioned


above) are calibrated by treating every parameter in the EBM as uncertain, not just a few that


are deemed to be the most vital (Cummins et al., 2020). This implies that different methodologies


are being used by those assessing climate sensitivity using EBMs based on past observations (see,


e.g., Chapter 4 in Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change (IPCC), 2023) and those making


predictions about how climate uncertainty will evolve in time. As a concrete example, we are not


currently aware of any study on the learning rate of climate sensitivity that treats the deep ocean heat


capacity as uncertain, despite the known difficulty in constraining it (see, for example, Geoffroy et al.,


2013a). By neglecting certain EBM parameters in the parameter estimation problem, past work may


have considerably underestimated the underlying covariance structure between many EBM parameters,


which could significantly change climate learning rate estimates both quantitatively and qualitatively.


Second, all previous studies treat the sensitivity of radiative forcing to CO 2 concentrations as given,


despite known uncertainty in the magnitude of the response of forcing to an injection of CO 2 into the


4


atmosphere (Zelinka et al., 2020; Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change (IPCC), 2023; He et al.,


2023). Past work therefore assumes all uncertainty in ECS comes from uncertainty in the climate


feedbacks, despite radiative forcing sensitivity uncertainty strongly trading-off with climate feedback


uncertainty in estimates of ECS uncertainty. Capturing this trade-off would likely alter the qualitative


features of climate learning rates.


Lastly, though some studies have pointed to the different characteristic timescales of the climate


response to warming as an important factor for climate learning rates (Urban et al., 2014), explicitly


decomposing the learning rates of the different climate modes, and connecting them to the overall


climate sensitivity learning rate, remains lacking. This analysis would provide physical insights into why


and how we may expect to learn about the climate in the future rather than relying on computational


models alone.


In light of the limitations and challenges described above, this paper presents a modeling framework


that merges an IPCC-consistent climate emulator with ensemble variational data assimilation to assess


the prospects and perils of learning ECS and TCR from hypothetical future observations of global


average temperature and ocean heat content. Our framework utilizes a weak-constraint, ensemble of


data assimilations (EDA) approach similar to those used in the weather forecasting literature (see, e.g.,


Isaksen et al., 2010) to incorporate “pseudo-observations” of the future climate to estimate the posterior


distribution of climate sensitivity and other climate parameters conditional on future observations (see


_Materials and Methods_ ).


Our modeling framework has two distinct advantages over past work. The first is we are able to


jointly estimate the conditional probability distribution of each parameter in our EBM, as opposed to


a subset of our parameter space. This allows us to capture trade-offs between CO 2 radiative forcing


sensitivity and climate feedbacks on the posterior distribution of ECS, while also accounting for the


impact of difficult-to-learn parameters, such as the deep ocean heat capacity, on our estimates of


learning rates. As we will see later, this has an especially substantive impact on the rate we are able


to learn ECS from future observations. The second is that, by using a so-called “weak-constraint”


variational framework (WC-VAR, see Evensen et al., 2022, and _Materials and Methods_ ), we are able


to account for the trade-off between estimating the climate _state_ – that is, what the true climatic


temperature is in the absence of internal climate variability – and estimating the internal climate


variability itself (Nicklas et al., 2024), a novelty in the climate learning rates literature.

### **2 Results**

We begin by demonstrating how the forecasted global surface temperature and the distributions of


ECS and TCR change as we add observations of global temperature and ocean heat content into


our assimilation window (see _Materials and Methods_ ). We generate pseudo-observations for 2020

2050 by forcing our two-layer model (Geoffroy et al., 2013a, and _Materials and Methods_ ) with CO 2


concentrations and sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) emissions from SSP2–4.5 (Riahi et al., 2017). We compute the


effective radiative forcing using the parameterizations in Leach et al. (2021). We then treat the time


period of 2020-2050 as our “analysis” period (Park and Zupanski, 2022), over which we minimize our


WC-VAR cost function for each of our 500 ensemble members. Because each ensemble member cost


function is independent, this procedure results in randomized maximum likelihood (RML) sampling of


the posterior conditional probability distribution function (PDF) (Evensen et al., 2022). We then use


the posterior distribution to forecast future temperature change.


In Figure 1, we show the projected future temperature rise using the prior distribution (pink), and


the forecasted future temperature rise using the posterior parameter distributions from the 2020-2050


assimilation window (blue) for a true values of ECS of 3 _[◦]_ C and a true TCR of 1.6 °C (Fig. 1 **a** ). Note


these values are equal to our ensemble prior central estimates; we will probe the dependence of our


results on what the true underlying value is later. We also compute the posterior distributions of ECS


and TCR for the prior distribution and the parameter posterior (Figs. 1 **b–c** ).


We find the estimated range of 2100 warming levels is significantly reduced after observations


of 2020-2050 temperature and ocean heat content are assimilated. Using our parameter priors, the


end-of-century warming 5-95 percentile range is 1.6 _[◦]_ C. After incorporating thirty additional years


of observations into our assimilation window, this range reduces to about 0.5 _[◦]_ C (a 66% reduction


relative to the prior) when the true value of ECS is 3 _[◦]_ C. This suggests that future observations may


be able to place a relatively tight constraint on end-of-century temperature rise, consistent with past


work (Shiogama et al., 2016).


Our ability to constrain end-of-century temperature rise may seem natural given that, in 2050,


our proximity to the end of the century is increased, and so the range of possible outcomes has less


time to “spread out”. However, our results would suggest that the narrowing of the end-of-century


temperature rise 5-95 percentile range is also in large part due to an improved ability to estimate


model parameters which, in turn, constrain ECS and TCR (see Figs. 1 **b–c** and corner plots in the

and TCR are 3 _[◦]_ C and 1.6 °C, respectively. The shaded regions are the 5-95 percentile range, and future
temperature pseudo-observations are shown in the black dots. **b** shows the prior ECS histogram (pink)

in **b–c**, dashed lines represent the 5-95 percentile range.

distribution of ECS evolves for different true values of ECS (solid lines) as the upper bound of our
assimilation window is pushed further into the future (and more observations are added to our assimilation window). The right is as the left, but for TCR.


_Supplementary Information_ ). We find that by mid-century, our approach provides a fairly robust


constraint on the central value of both ECS and TCR. In particular, we estimate the ECS ensemble


median to be 2.86 °C (5% error) and estimate a TCR ensemble median of 1.56 °C (3% error). Not


only are the ECS and TCR distribution medians estimated relatively well, but we also find nontrivial


reductions in uncertainty: the 5-95 percentile range the ECS distribution decreases by 42%, while the


5-95 percentile range of the TCR distributions decreases by 65%. These results – the narrowing of the


uncertainty band for end-of-century temperature rise, ECS, and TCR – would tentatively suggest that


there is some reason for hope in constraining uncertainty in these quantities in the future.


Are these results robust regardless of whether we live in an extremely high or low ECS or TCR


world? And how do these results change as more (or less) observations are incorporated into the


analysis window? To answer these questions, we carry out the same exercise demonstrated by Figure 1


for different true values of ECS and TCR and display the ECS and TCR posteriors in Figure 2 for


numerous analysis window upper bounds. We find that the degree to which one can ascertain the true


value of ECS by the end of the century varies significantly with what the true underlying value is.


For low values of ECS (yellow lines and distributions on the left in Figure 2), we find that the ECS is


learned efficiently by the end of the century, with very little difference in the posterior central estimate


and the true value (6.8% error) and a relatively tight 5-95 percentile range (1.16 °C). However, as we

estimate of the posterior ECS distribution (solid lines) and the true value of the ECS used to generate
the observations (dashed lines) as the assimilation window is moved further into the future (and more
observations are used for analysis). **b** shows the difference between the posterior central estimate and
the true value, while **c** shows the raw posterior 5-95 percentile range and the 5-95 percentile range

increase the true value of ECS, our approach grows increasingly unable to learn the true value; for a


high value of ECS ( _∼_ 5 °C, navy lines and distributions in Figure 2), the percent error between the end


of century posterior central estimate and the true value is about 16.2%, while posterior distribution


remains highly uncertain (5-95 percentile range of 2.9 °C).


However, we find that the persistence of uncertainty and bias in posterior central estimates is only


present for ECS. For TCR, even extremely high values are able to be learned by the end-of-century,


with uncertainty narrowing at a similar rate for each true values of TCR we consider (see the right side


of Figure 2). The percent difference between the true value and the end of century posterior central


estimate range from 0.19%-1.45%, a far smaller range than that of ECS. This would suggest that while


the prospects for ascertaining _equilibrium_ climate metrics, such as ECS, may depend on the underlying


true value, _transient_ climate metrics, like TCR, do not. Corner plots in the _Supplementary Information_


show that high climate sensitivity experiments struggle to disentangle the trade-offs between the climate


feedback strength and the CO 2 radiative forcing sensitivity (estimating a too-strong forcing and a too

strong feedback), while low climate sensitivity experiments estimate both parameters effectively.


We can summarize the above findings by showing the evolution of the posterior central estimate


9


and posterior 5-95 percentile range as more observations are assimilated in Figure 3 for numerous true


values of ECS and TCR. Figure 3 supports the findings of Figure 2: high values of ECS are unable to


be robustly estimated even with new observations through the end of the century (see Figs. 3 **a, b** ),


while the bias in the central estimate of TCR becomes virtually negligible by 2100 (Fig. 3 **e** ).


We further find that the ECS 5-95 percentile range decreases at a much slower rate (in relative


terms) than the TCR 5-95 percentile range (Figs. 3 **c, f** ). Indeed, we find that the degree to which


uncertainty decreases in the TCR is mostly independent of the true value; for each true value we


consider, the 5-95 percentile range is 33%-44% that of the prior once observations from 2020-2050


are assimilated, and is roughly constant thereafter. The ECS posterior, on the other hand, has a


5-95 percentile range between 40%-109% of the prior 5-95 range once observations from 2020-2050


are assimilated, and continues to decline somewhat thereafter. There is also significant stratification


between the different true values of ECS; in other words, our ability to narrow uncertainty in ECS


is more limited when ECS is high than when it is low. Hence, not only is our ability to match the


ensemble central estimate and the true value different for when we are estimating ECS or TCR, but


the rate at which we decrease uncertainty depends on if we are considering an equilibrium or transient


climate metric as well.


Why can we learn TCR faster and more robustly than ECS, both in terms of the central estimate


and the rate of uncertainty decline? We postulate that the physical intuition behind the differing


learning rates displayed in Figure 3 manifests in the relative amounts of warming attributed to the


fast and slow climate modes this century. Using our parameter prior and posterior after assimilating


observations from 2020-2050 ( _´a la_ Figure 1), we compute the contribution to temperature rise from


the fast and slow climate modes in Figure 4 **a–f** for low, average, and extreme values of ECS (see the


_Materials and Methods_ for details on our decomposition) when forced with SSP2–4.5. Contributions


from historical warming are negligible past a decade or two, and have been neglected for our discussion


here. We compute the relative fraction of warming from each climate mode in Figure 4 **g–i** .


We find that most of the uncertainty reduction from thirty years of observations (comparing the


pink and blue envelopes in Figure 4 **a–f** ) comes from constraining the fast climate mode. Comparatively,


slow mode uncertainty is recalcitrant, experiencing very little reduction in uncertainty (we even find a


minor increase in uncertainty in slow mode-contributed warming when ECS is large). These patterns


are consistent regardless of whether or not the true underlying ECS is low or high. Additionally, the


difference in uncertainty reduction between the fast and slow modes happens even while the central

values (see the titles). **d–f** is as **a–c**, but for the slow climate mode. **g, i, k** show the relative fraction

**l** show the same relative contribution to warming as **g, i, k**, but after the climate system has reached
equilibrium.


11


estimate of warming attributable to each mode changes to reflect the true climate sensitivity.


The difference in uncertainty reduction for the fast and slow climate mode can be explained by how


much near-term warming is attributable to the different modes of warming. We find that, in the 80


years following the beginning of our simulations, most of the warming found in our pseudo-observations


is attributable to the fast climate mode, regardless of the true value of ECS (panels 4 **g–i** ). Physically,


this is reflective of the vastly different characteristic timescales of adjustment between the atmosphere


and upper mixed ocean layer versus the deep ocean; the mixed ocean layer has an average characteristic


timescale of _∼_ 10 years, whereas the deep ocean has a characteristic timescale of _∼_ 200 years (Geoffroy


et al., 2013a). Because warming attributed to the deep ocean manifests over far longer timescales,


near-term information on temperature rise is more useful for constraining the fast climate mode, which


is the primary contributor to near-term temperature changes and, in turn, the estimated TCR and end


of century temperature change (Baker and Roe, 2009).


This difference in characteristic timescales between the fast and slow mode of warming can further


explain the bias we observed in our central estimates of high values of ECS in Figures 2 and 3. We


found that if the true underlying value of ECS is high, our central estimate of ECS maintains a lingering


bias, even when pseudo-observations are assimilated through the end of the century. This was not the


case for low values of ECS. The difference between cases where ECS is high or low is related to how


much warming is attributable to each climate mode _in equilibrium_, see Figure 4 **g–l** . For low values


of ECS, the amount of warming attributable to the slow mode in equilibrium is about 42%, whereas


for high values of ECS, the relative amount of warming is about 56%. This means that for low values


of ECS, the deep ocean accounts for less overall warming than the fast mode even after the climate


system has equilibrated, whereas the when ECS is high, the deep ocean accounts for the majority of


the equilibrium warming. (We prove this explicitly in the _Materials and Methods_ .) Hence, our ability


to constrain the fast mode of warming when ECS is low contributes to a tighter constraint on _both_


ECS and TCR, while for high values of ECS, the fast mode can only partially constrain ECS while still


tightly constraining TCR.


These findings imply that no matter what the true value of ECS is, the information from the next


50 years will be primarily useful for constraining the fast climate mode. In turn, information on the


fast climate mode will be primarily useful for constraining transient climate metrics, such as the TCR,


and only partially useful for constraining ECS. The remaining information to constrain ECS – that


is, the warming attributable to the slow mode – will not arrive until hundreds of years hence when


12


the climate system approaches equilibrium, implying that prospects for constraining ECS based on


future observations remain limited from a purely physical perspective, and is corroborated by our data


assimilation approach.

### **3 Discussion**


Our work highlights the key underlying factors important for constraining climate sensitivity from new


observations of global temperature and ocean heat content. Our key takeaway is that the prospects for


constraining climate sensitivity critically depends on if one is aiming to constrain an equilibrium or a


transient climate metric.


For equilibrium climate sensitivity, we find that our ability to constrain ECS varies depending on


the true underlying value; low values of ECS may be constrained by century’s end, while high values


of ECS are unable to be efficiently estimated even after an additional 80 years of pseudo-observations.


Likewise, uncertainty in the distribution of ECS will remain wide for high values of ECS, while for low


values of ECS uncertainty may be narrowed by mid-century. The core reason for this asymmetry in


the learning rate of ECS for different true values lies in two physical characteristics of the climate: the


slow ocean response timescale, which limits the utility of near-term information for constraining ECS,


and the fact that the slow mode accounts for a large (small, resp.) share of equilibrium warming when


ECS is larger (smaller, resp.) than average. In this way, our work would suggest that if the true value


of ECS is large, not only will climate damages be more acute (because temperatures are higher than if


ECS is low), but climate risk will also be persistent through the end of the century.


On the other hand, our work would suggest that transient climate metrics, such as end-of-century


temperature rise and the transient climate response, may be estimated with some confidence by end


of century. We find that the central estimate of TCR has very little bias by the end of the century


regardless of the true underlying value, and uncertainty narrows at a relatively rapid rate. This can be


explained by end-of-century temperature rise and TCR being primarily controlled by the fast climate


mode, which can be tightly constrained in the near-term as CO 2 -induced warming rises and aerosol


emissions decline. One may therefore be optimistic about narrowing TCR uncertainty in the coming


years, despite the prospects for constraining ECS being less easy to judge.


One limitation of our analysis is that we treat our climate feedback parameter and the sensitivity


of radiative forcing on CO 2 concentrations as independent from the underlying climate state. However,


13


it has been shown that both of these processes are dependent on the underlying pattern of warming


(Zhou et al. (2017), Armour (2017), and Dong et al. (2019) explore the spatial dependence of climate


feedbacks, while He et al. (2023) explores the state dependence of radiative forcing). In general, it is


difficult to capture these effects in global, simplified climate models given their spatial dependence,


though we do include an efficacy parameter in our energy balance model that modulates the top of


atmosphere energy imbalance to approximate them (Held et al., 2010; Cummins et al., 2020; Leach


et al., 2021). Including state dependent feedbacks would likely lower our learning rates presented here,


given that the transient patterns of warming would obfuscate or ability to learn the “true” underlying


climate sensitivity during the adjustment period. We note that our framework is amenable with


a dynamic, time-dependent climate feedback or radiative forcing sensitivity, and future work could


incorporate these effects to evaluate their impact on climate learning rates. We expect that while


the our quantitative results would be impacted by including these effects, our core physical insight


(that transient metrics can be learned more effectively than equilibrium metrics) will still hold in the


modified framework.


Our findings have direct implications for climate risk assessment and policymaking. At a techni

cal level, our modeling framework puts forth a methodology to update uncertainty as more pseudo

observations are incorporated into climate model projections. One can image merging our framework


with a scenario-based approach to climate risk management in the insurance or financial sector, which


would allow climate risk can evolve endogenously with the emissions scenario under consideration,


enabling for a more holistic assessment of climate risk in decision-making (see, e.g., Neubersch et al.,


2014).


For policymakers, the rate at which one can learn about the climate system – often coined “active


learning” – has been shown to be important for estimates of the social cost of carbon (SCC) (Kelly and


Kolstad, 1999; Leach, 2007; Kelly and Tan, 2015; Lemoine and Rudik, 2017). Our results suggest that


the degree to which active learning plays a role in policymaking depends on whether one is considering


long- or short-run climate policies. Long-run climate policies often rely on ECS as the key source of


climate risk (Weitzman, 2012), though recently some models utilize the transient climate response to


emissions to map cumulative CO 2 emissions to temperature rise (Allen et al., 2009; Campiglio et al.,


2022). Short-run policies, on the other hand, often rely on carbon budgets as their main source of


climate uncertainty (e.g., Bauer et al., 2024a). Given that the remaining carbon budget is a transient


climate metric, it is likely that the quantitative implications of active learning will play a larger role


14


for carbon budget-based policies than ECS-based policies.


Overall, our analysis suggests that while uncertainty will remain persistent despite new information


on the climate over the coming years, we can expect some decline in uncertainty as more observations


of the CO 2 -warming-dominated climate are assimilated into climate models. Our results provide a


physical underpinning for why transient climate metrics are learned at a disproportionally fast rate


compared to equilibrium climate metrics. However, our results are meant to be a stylized demonstration


of this fact, and many climatic processes likely will obscure learning from happening as quickly as we


have demonstrated here. For example, our quantitative results would need to be reassessed if, say,


climate change triggers fundamental process-level changes that are not included in our two-layer box


model (e.g., accelerated permafrost melt). Despite of these limitations, our results suggests that there


are fundamental physical reasons to expect that we may be able to constrain climate sensitivity from


new observations in the future, and that, depending on the climate metric of interest, these constraints


may be substantial.

### **4 Materials and Methods**


**4.1** **Summary of our modeling approach**


We utilize pseudo-observations and an ensemble of data assimilations (EDA) approach to estimate


the rate at which climate sensitivity, and other climate metrics, are learned conditional on future


observations of the global climate. Using a large ensemble (in our case, 500 members), we minimize


an ensemble of cost functions that allows us to sample the posterior distribution of model states,


parameters, and errors conditional on observations of the climate. Throughout, we use a two-layer


climate emulator (Geoffroy et al., 2013a) to compute the global surface temperature and ocean heat


content, and use the forcing representation of FaIR v2.0.0 (Leach et al., 2021) to compute the radiative


forcing of each of our forcing agents (e.g., aerosols and greenhouse gases). Our model is forced with CO 2


concentrations time series and SO 2 emissions time series from SSP2–4.5 (and SSP5–8.5 in a sensitivity


analysis) (Riahi et al., 2017).


We apply our modeling approach in a so-called “perfect model” context (Urban et al., 2014), where


we generate synthetic observations of the past and future using the same model we attempt to fit the


data with. The only difference in the “perfect model” case is that the observations are forced with a


15


known stochastic component, whereas the retrieved model fit is forced with an unknown forcing that


we treat as a control variable (as is standard in WC-VAR). We vary the true underlying value of ECS


and TCR by altering the climate feedback parameter, _λ_, which allows us to probe how the learning


rate about climate sensitivity changes for different true values of ECS or TCR.


**4.2** **2-layer energy balance model**


We consider a stochastic two-layer energy balance model (EBM) to emulate the global climate (Ge

offroy et al., 2013a,b). We force the EBM with an exogenous path of CO 2 concentrations and sulfur


dioxide (SO 2 ) emissions, each of which are mapped to an effective radiative forcing through the pa

rameterization of Leach et al. (2021). In general, if the species of molecules whose radiative forcing


are specified by concentrations (emissions, resp.) are given by the set _C_ ( _E_, resp.) we can write the


cumulative radiative forcing at a time _t_ as

The radiative forcing given by (4.1) forces the two layer model given by


_C_ 1 _dT_ _t_ [(1)] = _F_ _t_ _−_ _λT_ _t_ [(1)] + _εγ_ _T_ _t_ [(2)] _−_ _T_ _t_ [(1)] + _q_ _t_ (4.2)

where layer _i_ has a heat capacity _C_ _i_ _>_ 0 with _i ∈{_ 1 _,_ 2 _}_, _λ >_ 0 is the climate feedback, _γ >_ 0 is the


transfer coefficient between layers, _ε >_ 0 is the ocean heat uptake efficacy, and _q_ _t_ are model errors.


When we use (4.2)-(4.3) to generate noisy synthetic observations, _q_ _t_ = _ε_ _t_, where _ε_ _t_ is a stochastic


forcing term that represents internal climate variability. We draw vectors of internal variability such


that _⃗ε ∼N_ ( _[⃗]_ 0 _,_ _**I**_ ), where _**I**_ is the temporal covariance matrix of internal climate variability. In general,


the time average of _q_ _t_ represents model bias, and the temporal covariance represents the covariance


structure of internal climate variability.


Importantly, from the integrated paths of (4.2)-(4.3), we can compute the ocean heat content, _Q_ _t_,


16


as


_Q_ _t_ = _C_ 1 _T_ _t_ [(1)] + _C_ 2 _T_ _t_ [(2)] _._ (4.4)


The ocean heat content is a commonly assimilated observation in estimating climate parameters owing


to its dependence on the deep ocean temperature, _T_ _t_ [(2)] . We can then write an amended two layer model


where the ocean heat content is also integrated, as


_C_ 1 _dT_ _t_ [(1)] = _F_ _t_ _−_ _λT_ _t_ [(1)] + _εγ_ _T_ _t_ [(2)] _−_ _T_ _t_ [(1)] + _q_ _t_ (4.5)

We discretize (4.5)-(4.7) using a standard forward Eurler scheme.

components individually in Figure 4 using our parameter posteriors.


**4.2.2** **Fast and slow mode contributions to equilibrium warming**


In the main text, we asserted that higher ECS worlds have more warming that is attributable to the


slow climate mode in equilibrium. We now make this notion theoretically concrete. Suppose the fast


mode contribution to warming can be well-approximated by the transient climate response, given by


∆ _T_ _fast_ _≈_ _TCR_ = _λ_ _[F]_ + [2] _[×]_ _γ_ _[.]_ (4.14)


18


Then the slow mode contribution can be written as the remaining warming in equilibrium, i.e.,



∆ _T_ _slow_ _≈_ _ECS −_ _TCR_ = _[F]_ [2] _[×]_



(4.15)
_λ_ + _γ_




[2] _[×]_

_−_ _[F]_ [2] _[×]_
_λ_ _λ_ +



_γF_ 2 _×_
=
(4.16)
_λ_ ( _γ_ + _λ_ ) _[.]_


Then the ratio of warming attributed to each mode can be written as


∆ _T_ _slow_
= _[γ]_ (4.17)
∆ _T_ _λ_ _[.]_
_fast_


Therefore, assuming minimal correlation between _γ_ and _λ_, in worlds with low _λ_ (high ECS), the


contribution from the slow mode increases nonlinearly, as supported by the calculations in Figure 4.


**4.3** **Ensemble of data assimilations**


The EDA has two primary components: a tangent linear model (TLM) and a cost function, which we


develop in turn below. Of particular importance is how a TLM, which can easily be translated into an


adjoint model (ADJM), allows for efficient computation of the gradient of the cost function (Errico,


1997). Throughout we closely follow Park and Zupanski (2022) (see their Chapter 4), and refer readers


to their exposition for additional technical details.


**4.3.1** **Tangent linear model**


In this section, we introduce the general concept of TLMs, and how they can be verified. In general,


any dynamical operator (or “propagator”), _**M**_ _t_ : R _[N]_ _→_ R _[N]_, that maps a vector of inputs _**X**_ _t_ _∈_ R _[N]_ at


a time _t_ to the derivative of _**X**_ can be written as


_d_ _**X**_ _t_

= _**M**_ _t_ ( _**X**_ _t_ ) _._ (4.18)
_dt_


Note that _**X**_ _t_ is a collection of model states, and if one is interested in estimating model parameters


or model errors, these are included in _**X**_ _t_ and are assumed to be stationary; i.e., _dξ/dt_ = 0 for an


19


arbitrary model parameter or error _ξ_ . For a small perturbation _δ_ _**X**_ _t_, we can Taylor expand (4.18) as



_d_
_dt_ [(] _**[X]**_ _[t]_ [ +] _[ δ]_ _**[X]**_ _[t]_ [) =] _**[ M]**_ _[ t]_ [ (] _**[X]**_ _[t]_ [) +] _[ ∂]_ _∂_ _**[M]**_ _**X**_ _t_ _[ t]_



_δ_ _**X**_ _t_ + _O_ � _||δ_ _**X**_ _t_ _||_ [2] [�] (4.19)
���� _**X**_ _t_



_≈_ _**M**_ _t_ ( _**X**_ _t_ ) + _**L**_ _t_ _δ_ _**X**_ _t_ (4.20)



where



_**L**_ _t_ := _[∂]_ _**[M]**_ _[ t]_

_∂_ _**X**_ _t_



(4.21)
���� _**X**_ _t_



is the TLM at time _t_ and we have neglected higher order terms. In general, the TLM is a square matrix


with shape _N × N_, where _N_ is the number of control variables one has in their VAR problem. As we


will see later, the TLM is of practical importance because of its relationship to the ADJM, and via


the ADJM, the gradient of the cost function. To verify that the TLM has been coded correctly and is


operating as expected, we can introduce an arbitrary parameter _α >_ 0 and use (4.20) to define


_R_ _α_ := _[||]_ _**[M]**_ _[ t]_ [(] _**[X]**_ _[t]_ [ +] _[ αδ]_ _**[X]**_ _[t]_ [)] _[ −]_ _**[M]**_ _[ t]_ [(] _**[X]**_ _[t]_ [)] _[||]_ [2] (4.22)

_α||_ _**L**_ _t_ _δ_ _**X**_ _t_ _||_ 2


where _|| · ||_ 2 is the _L_ 2 -norm. If the TLM is coded correctly, one will find that lim _α→_ 0 _[R]_ _[α]_ _[ →]_ [1.]


**4.3.2** **Cost function**


The cost function, _J_, can be written in terms of two components: _J_ _guess_, which quantifies the cost


of control variables far away from their “first-guess” estimates, and _J_ _obs_, that penalizes model misfit


with observations. Both parts of the cost function are assumed to be derived from Gaussian likeli

hoods (Evensen et al., 2022).


We begin with _J_ _guess_ . Assume that each control variable listed in Table 2 is written as _⃗x_ 0, and that


each control variable as a first-guess of _⃗χ_ with covariance of the joint prior distribution given by _**P**_ .


Then we can write _J_ _guess_ as

_J_ _guess_ = [1] 2 [(] _[⃗x]_ [0] _[ −]_ _[⃗χ]_ [)] _[T]_ _**[ P]**_ _[ −]_ [1] [ (] _[⃗x]_ [0] _[ −]_ _[⃗χ]_ [)] _[ .]_ (4.23)


As for _J_ _obs_, we write the superposition of two cost functions that quantify deviations in the surface


temperature observations and ocean heat content. If _T_ _[⃗]_ [(] _[obs]_ [)] is a vector of observations of surface

where **Σ** _T_ ( **Σ** _Q_, resp.) is the error covariance matrix between observations of surface temperature


(ocean heat content, resp.).


Combining (4.23) and (4.24), we can write our cost function as


_J_ = _J_ _guess_ + _J_ _obs_

= [1]

The goal of VAR is to minimize this cost function; if we are able to find a global minimum of (4.25),


then our EDA approach is guaranteed to be a randomized maximum likelihood sampling (RML) of the


posterior probability distribution function (PDF). Finding the global minimum requires the gradient


of the cost function, and we develop a formalism for computing the cost function gradient next.


**4.3.3** **Connecting the TLM and the cost function gradient**


The final piece of the VAR approach is to compute the gradient of the cost function (4.25). Throughout,


we will define a vector of control variables at a time _t_ as _⃗x_ _t_, which is simply a vector containing all


of the listed quantities in Table 2. We will work in two parts, focusing on computing the gradient of


_J_ _guess_ and _J_ _obs_ separately; for _J_ _obs_, we will follow the chain rule-based approach of Talagrand (1991)


and Errico and Vukicevic (1992) to compute the gradient of the cost function with respect to the initial


condition of the _n_ [th] component of _⃗x_ _t_ inductively.


Starting with _J_ _guess_, the gradient is relatively trivial. Let _x_ [(] 0 _[n]_ [)] be the _n_ [th] component of _⃗x_ 0, suppose


there are _N_ control variables, and let _p_ _i,j_ be the ( _i, j_ ) [th] element of _**P**_ _[−]_ [1] . Then directly differentiat

where we have exploited the fact that covariance matrices are symmetric by definition (and therefore


so are their inverses).


For _J_ _obs_, we derive the gradient with respect to _x_ [(] 0 _[n]_ [)] inductively. Let _σ_ _i,j_ [(] _[T]_ [)] ( _σ_ _i,j_ [(] _[Q]_ [)] [, resp.) be the]

( _i, j_ ) [th] component of **Σ** _[−]_ _T_ [1] ( **Σ** _[−]_ _Q_ [1] [, resp.) and define]

where ( _**L**_ _t_ ) _[∗]_ is the adjoint of the TLM. In this way, misfits in the gradient at time _t_ = _T_ are propagated


backward in time by the ADJM to _t_ = _T −_ 1. This approach can be carried out inductively to form


a dynamical system, where at every time _t_ there is a “forcing” term _F_ _[⃗]_ _t_ (given by (4.30) where _T_ is


replaced by _t_ ) and a propagated term involving the ADJM and all other forcings for _t_ _[′]_ _> t_ . Integrating


this dynamical system back to the initial condition (i.e., from _t_ = _T →_ _t_ = 0) results in the gradient of


_J_ _obs_, as desired.


We can check the validity of our ADJM and the gradient of the cost function by introducing two


quantities. The first tests the validity of the ADJM; using the definition of the adjoint (Park and


Zupanski, 2022), we can write

where _δ_ _**X**_ is a perturbed state vector. This identity essentially compares the forward propagated path


of the TLM and the backward propagated path of the ADJM. If the program is running correctly, for


small numbers of timesteps, Λ _t_ _≈_ 1, and Λ _t_ will diverge from one the more timesteps are taken.


The second quantity we can introduce serves to check our computation of the cost function gradient.


For an arbitrary parameter _α >_ 0 and vector _**h**_, we can define


[(] _**[X]**_ [ +] _[ α]_ _**[h]**_ [)] _[ −]_ _[J]_ [(] _**[X]**_ [)]
Φ _α_ := _[J]_ _,_ (4.34)

_α_ _**h**_ _[T]_ _**∇**_ _J_ ( _**X**_ )


using the definition of a Taylor expansion similar to our derivation of (4.22). It is common practice to


set _**h**_ = _**∇**_ _J_ ( _**X**_ ), but (4.34) is obviously general for any _**h**_ . As was the case with (4.22), we expect a


correctly formulated cost function gradient to have the limiting behavior of lim _α→_ 0 [Φ] _[α]_ _[ →]_ [1.]


**4.3.4** **Verification of TLM, ADJM, and cost function gradient**


To verify the validity of our formulation, we compute (4.22), (4.33), and (4.34) for a number of pertur

bation sizes and timesteps in Figure 5. We find that each quantity displays the expected behavior for


a correctly programmed TLM, ADJM, and cost function gradient. In particular, _R_ _α_ and Φ _α_ approach


unity for decreasingly small perturbation sizes, and Λ _t_ starts close to unity for a small number of


24


**Figure 5:** **Check plots for TLM, ADJM, and cost function gradient.** Panels **a–c**
show (4.22), (4.33), and (4.34) for a number of values of _α_ (or timesteps taken, in the case of panel **b** ).
**d–f** are as **a–c**, but on a logarithmic scale.


timesteps before diverging as more are taken. Moreover, on a logarithmic scale, _R_ _α_ and Φ _α_ display the


normal “V”-shaped patterns as is usually found in such computations (Park and Zupanski, 2022).


**4.3.5** **Synthesis**


We now combine each of the prior subsections to summarize our EDA approach. Assuming the control


variables have a prior distribution _⃗χ ∼N_ ( _⃗χ_ _[p]_ _,_ _**P**_ ), we sample this prior _N_ _ens_ times to form an ensemble


of “particles”. Each particle’s cost function is given by (4.25), where _⃗χ_ is the prior draw for that particle.


This prior draw serves as the first “first-guess” in the VAR inner- and outer-loop procedure (Park


and Zupanski, 2022); it is then updated in the outer-loop of the VAR gradient descent algorithm


as the algorithm searches for better solutions to the minimization. We use sequential least-squares


programming to solve the inner-loop minimization problem (Noceda and Wright, 2006). An example


of an abbreviated corner plot when the true ECS is average is shown in Figure 6 where we show


the abbreviated parameter posteriors for the 2020-2050 assimilation window; see the _Supplementary_


_Information_ for more corner plots when ECS is low and high, as well as the full parameter corner


plots. See Rabier and Liu (2003) and Bannister (2017) for a review of the technical aspects of the VAR


25


**Figure 6: Abbreviated parameter posteriors for average true value of ECS.** Black solid lines
represent the ensemble median estimate, while the dashed lines represent the true value. Parameter
posteriors shown are for the 2020-2060 assimilation window. This is a truncated corner plot where we
only show a subset parameters that we estimate in our data assimilation approach: _λ_, _γ_, _C_ 2, _f_ 1 [(] _[CO]_ [2] [)],
_f_ 2 [(] _[SO]_ [2] [)], _ε_ .

approach.


We minimize each cost function using VAR, utilizing the cost function gradient derived using (4.26)


and by integrating (4.31) recursively backwards in time. The result is an optimized ensemble of state


estimates that allow us to sample the posterior of our model states, model parameters, and model


errors conditional on our data in the assimilation window; indeed, insofar as we find global minima


of (4.25), we are guaranteed a randomized maximum likelihood sampling of the posterior since each


particle’s cost function is independent (Evensen et al., 2022). We establish a convergence criterion


that, after 100 iterations of VAR, the cost function must be below 10 [2], which places the cut-off just


over the average 97 [th] percentile in our summary statistics, see Table 3. See Figure 7 for an example of


our screening methodology.


**4.4** **Details on prior**


It remains to describe how we chose our prior for each parameter we estimate in our approach. For


each box’s initial condition, _T_ 0 [(1)] and _T_ 0 [(2)] [, we warm start our model starting in 1850, and integrate]


the model until 2020 using the true values of each other parameter in our model. We then assign a 0.2


°C standard deviation to the prior distribution to account for internal variability and the possibility of


errors in measuring the current global average temperature.


We pull the central estimates for our thermal response parameters ( _λ_, _γ_, _C_ 1, and _C_ 2 ) from Geoffroy


et al. (2013a). Note we slightly revise upwards the estimate of _λ_ (1.13 _→_ 1.258) to achieve an average


ECS of 3 °C, in line with recent estimates (Sherwood et al., 2020). However, Geoffroy et al. (2013a)


calibrates their two-layer model on only 16 climate models, which calls into question their reported


27


28


**Figure 7: Cost function versus iteration.** We plot the cost function for each ensemble member
against the VAR iteration number, where valid ensemble members are shown in gray, the ensemble
median is in black, and rejected ensemble members are in red. These data are generated for our twolayer model forced with SSP2–4.5 with a true ECS of 6 °C. Note the upper bound of the assimilation
window is 2090.


standard deviations for each of these parameter distributions, especially given the correlation structure


they report between parameters in their posteriors (see their Tables 2 and 3). These factors complicate


the prior for the thermal response parameters. We therefore take a more na¨ıve approach: to assign


a standard deviation of 30% error for each parameter. This procedure results in an approximately


similar distribution for _λ_, a wider distribution for _γ_ and _C_ 1, and a slightly narrower distribution for


_C_ 2 . Sensitivity tests with a 40% spread in the prior yield similar results as what was reported in the


main text (see the _Supplementary Information_ ).


We pull the central estimate and standard deviation of _f_ 1 [(] _[CO]_ [2] [)] from Zelinka et al. (2020), their Table


S1. Note that Zelinka et al. (2020) reports the central estimate and variance of effective radiative forcing


from a doubling of CO 2 in CMIP6 climate models; their values were converted into a central estimate


and standard deviation for the _f_ 1 [(] _[CO]_ [2] [)] parameter by dividing by ln 2.


For the remaining radiative forcing parameters ( _f_ 3 [(] _[CO]_ [2] [)], _f_ 1 [(SO] [2] [)], _f_ 2 [(SO] [2] [)], and _C_ 0 [(] _[SO]_ [2] [)] ), we pull the


central estimates from Leach et al. (2021). Unfortunately, Leach et al. (2021) does not report individual


parameter uncertainties, and only the uncertainty in overall radiative forcing from different forcing


agents. We therefore take a similar approach to the above and assign a 30% error for each parameter.


29


See the below for sensitivity tests; we find that a wider prior results in similar findings. Note that


_f_ 2 [(] _[CO]_ [2] [)] = 0, following Leach et al. (2021).


Finally, we calibrate the internal climate variability using the AR(1) process following Proistosescu


and Huybers (2017). We follow their formulation to write variability in the radiative forcing, _q_ _t_, as an


AR(1) process such that


_q_ _t_ +1 = _φq_ _t_ + _ε_ _t_ +1 (4.35)


where _ε_ _t_ _∼N_ (0 _, σ_ ) and _φ ≥_ 0. We take the central estimate for _σ_ from Proistosescu and Huybers


(2017), and perform sensitivity tests for higher value of _σ_ (0.4 W m _[−]_ [2] ) below. We take a slightly


higher value of _φ_ (0.2, compared to 0.03) in our calibration compared to Proistosescu and Huybers


(2017) to account for the higher autocorrelation in global temperature than top of atmosphere radiative


imbalance. See Table 4 for a summary.
